<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><i>Specimens of the Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</i>, which the
poet's nephew and son-in-law, Henry Nelson Coleridge, published in 1835,
was a popular book from the first, and has won the approval of two
generations of readers. Unlike the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, or the
original and revised versions of <i>The Friend</i>, which never had their day
at all, or the <i>Aids to Reflection</i>, which passed through many editions,
but now seems to have delivered its message, the <i>Table Talk</i> is still
well known and widely read, and that not only by students of literature.
The task which the editor set himself was a difficult one, but it lay
within the powers of an attentive listener, possessed of a good memory
and those rarer gifts of a refined and scholarly taste, a sound and
luminous common sense. He does not attempt to reproduce Coleridge's
conversation or monologue or impassioned harangue, but he preserves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>notes down the detached fragments of knowledge and wisdom which fell
from time to time from the master's lips. Here are "the balmy sunny
islets of the blest and the intelligible," an unvexed and <i>harbourous</i>
archipelago. Very sparingly, if at all, have those pithy "sentences" and
weighty paragraphs been trimmed or pruned by the pious solicitude of the
memorialist, but it must be borne in mind that the unities are more or
less consciously observed, alike in the matter of the discourse and the
artistic presentation to the reader. There is, in short, not merely a
"mechanic" but an "organic regularity" in the composition of the work as
a whole. A "myriad-minded" sage, who has seen men and cities, who has
read widely and shaped his thoughts in a peculiar mould, is pouring out
his stores of knowledge, the garnered fruit of a life of study and
meditation, for the benefit of an apt learner, a discreet and
appreciative disciple. A day comes when the marvellous lips are
constrained to an endless silence, and it becomes the duty and privilege
of the beloved and honoured pupil to "snatch from forgetfulness" and to
hand down to posterity the great tradition of his master's eloquence. A
labour of love so useful and so fascinating was accomplished by the
gifted editor of the <i>Table Talk</i>, and it was accomplished once for all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>The compilation of a new <i>Table Talk</i>, if it were possible, would be a
mistake and an impertinence.</p>

<p>The present collection of hitherto unpublished aphorisms, reflections,
confessions and soliloquies, which for want of a better name I have
entitled <i>Anima Poet&aelig;</i>, does not in any way challenge comparison with
the <i>Table Talk</i>. It is, indeed, essentially different, not only in the
sources from which it has been compiled but in constitution and in aim.</p>

<p>"Since I left you," writes Coleridge in a letter to Wordsworth of May
12, 1812, "my pocket-books have been my sole confidants." Doubtless, in
earlier and happier days, he had been eager not merely to record but to
communicate to the few who would listen or might understand the
ceaseless and curious workings of his ever-shaping imagination, but from
youth to age note-books and pocket-books were his silent confidants, his
"never-failing friends" by night and day.</p>

<p>More than fifty of these remarkable documents are extant. The earliest
of the series, which dates from 1795 and which is known as the "Gutch
Memorandum Book," was purchased in 1868 by the trustees of the British
Museum, and is now exhibited in the King's Library. It consists, for the
most part, of fragments of prose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> and verse thrown off at the moment,
and stored up for future use in poem or lecture or sermon. A few of
these fragments were printed in the <i>Literary Remains</i> (4 vols.
1836-39), and others are to be found (pp. 103, 5, 6, 9 <i>et passim</i>) in
Herr Brandl's <i>Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the English Romantic School</i>.
The poetical fragments are printed <i>in extenso</i> in Coleridge's <i>Poetical
Works</i> (Macmillan, 1893), pp. 453-58. A few specimens of the prose
fragments have been included in the first chapter of this work. One of
the latest note-books, an unfinished folio, contains the Autobiographic
Note of 1832, portions of which were printed in Gillman's <i>Life of
Coleridge</i>, pp. 9-33, and a mass of unpublished matter, consisting
mainly of religious exercises and biblical criticism.</p>

<p>Of the intervening collection of pocket-books, note-books, copy-books,
of all shapes, sizes and bindings, a detailed description would be
tedious and out of place. Their contents may be roughly divided into
diaries of tours in Germany, the Lake District, Scotland, Sicily and
Italy; notes for projected and accomplished works, rough drafts of
poems, schemes of metre and metrical experiments; notes for lectures on
Shakspere and other dramatists; quotations from books of travel, from
Greek, Latin, German and Italian classics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> with and without critical
comments; innumerable fragments of metaphysical and theological
speculation; and commingled with this unassorted medley of facts and
thoughts and fancies, an occasional and intermitted record of personal
feeling, of love and friendship, of disappointment and regret, of
penitence and resolve, of faith and hope in the Unseen.</p>

<p>Hitherto, but little use has been made of this life-long accumulation of
literary material. A few specimens, "Curiosities of Literature" they
might have been called, were contributed by Coleridge himself to
Southey's <i>Omniana</i> of 1812, and a further selection of some fifty
fragments, gleaned from note-books 21-1/2 and 22, and from a third
unnumbered MS. book now in my possession, were printed by H. N.
Coleridge in the first volume of the <i>Literary Remains</i> under the
heading <i>Omniana 1809-1816</i>. The <i>Omniana</i> of 1812 were, in many
instances, re-written by Coleridge before they were included in
Southey's volumes, and in the later issue, here and there, the editor
has given shape and articulation to an unfinished or half-formed
sentence. The earlier and later <i>Omniana</i>, together with the fragments
which were published by Allsop in his <i>Letters, Conversations and
Recollections of S. T. Coleridge</i>, in 1836, were included by the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Thomas Ashe in his reprint of the <i>Table Talk</i>, Bell &amp; Co., 1884.</p>

<p>Some fourteen or fifteen notes of singular interest and beauty, which
belong to the years 1804, 1812, 1826, 1829, etc., were printed by James
Gillman in his unfinished "Life of Coleridge," and it is evident that he
contemplated a more extended use of the note-books in the construction
of his second volume, or, possibly, the publication of a supplementary
volume of notes or <i>Omniana</i>. Transcripts which were made for this
purpose are extant, and have been placed at my disposal by the kindness
of Mrs. Henry Watson, who inherited them from her grandmother, Mrs.
Gillman.</p>

<p>I may add that a few quotations from diaries of tours in the Lake
Country and on the Continent are to be found in the foot-notes appended
to the two volumes of <i>Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</i> which were
issued in the spring of the present year.</p>

<p>To publish the note-books <i>in extenso</i> would be impracticable, if even
after the lapse of sixty years since the death of the writer it were
permissible. They are private memoranda-books, and rightly and properly
have been regarded as a sacred trust by their several custodians. But it
is none the less certain that in disburthening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> himself of the ideas and
imaginations which pressed upon his consciousness, in committing them to
writing and carefully preserving them through all his wanderings,
Coleridge had no mind that they should perish utterly. The invisible
pageantry of thought and passion which for ever floated into his
spiritual ken, the perpetual hope, the half-belief that the veil of the
senses would be rent in twain, and that he and not another would be the
first to lay bare the mysteries of being, and to solve the problem of
the ages&mdash;of these was the breath of his soul. It was his fate to
wrestle from night to morn with the Angel of the Vision, and of that
unequal combat he has left, by way of warning or encouragement, a broken
but an inspired and inspiring record. "Hints and first thoughts" he bade
us regard the contents of his memorandum-books&mdash;"<i>cogitabilia</i> rather
than <i>cogitata</i> a me, not fixed opinions," and yet acts of obedience to
the apostolic command of "Try all things: hold fast that which is
good"&mdash;say, rather, acts of obedience to the compulsion of his own
genius to "take a pen and write in a book all the words of the vision."</p>

<p>The aim of the present work, however imperfectly accomplished, has been
to present in a compendious shape a collection of unpublished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> aphorisms
and sentences, and at the same time to enable the reader to form some
estimate of those strange self-communings to which Coleridge devoted so
much of his intellectual energies, and by means of which he hoped to
pass through the mists and shadows of words and thoughts to a steadier
contemplation, to the apprehension if not the comprehension of the
mysteries of Truth and Being.</p>

<p>The various excerpts which I have selected for publication are arranged,
as far as possible, in chronological order. They begin with the
beginning of Coleridge's literary career, and are carried down to the
summer of 1828, when he accompanied Wordsworth and his daughter Dora on
a six months' tour on the Continent. The series of note-books which
belong to the remaining years of his life (1828-1834) were devoted for
the most part to a commentary on the Old and New Testament, to
theological controversy, and to metaphysical disquisition. Whatever
interest they may have possessed, or still possess, appeals to the
student, not to the general reader. With his inveterate love of humorous
or facetious titles, Coleridge was pleased to designate these serious
and abstruse dissertations as "The Flycatchers."</p>

<p>My especial thanks are due to Amy, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> Coleridge, who, in accordance
with the known wishes of the late Lord Coleridge, has afforded me every
facility for collating my own transcripts of the note-books, and those
which were made by my father and other members of my family, with the
original MSS. now in her possession.</p>

<p>I have to also thank Miss Edith Coleridge for valuable assistance in the
preparation of the present work for the press.</p>

<p>The death of my friend, Mr. James Dykes Campbell, has deprived me of aid
which he alone could give.</p>

<p>It was due to his suggestion and encouragement that I began to compile
these pages, and only a few days before his death he promised me (it was
all he could undertake) to "run through the proofs with my pencil in my
hand." He has passed away <i>multis flebilis</i>, but he lived to accomplish
his own work both as critic and biographer, and to leave to all who
follow in his footsteps a type and example of honest workmanship and of
literary excellence.</p>

<p>"We should judge of absent things by the absent. Objects which are
present are apt to produce perceptions too strong to be impartially
compared with those recalled only by the memory." <span class="smcap">Sir J. Stewart.</span></p>

<p>True! and O how often the very opposite is true likewise, namely, that
the objects of memory are, often, so dear and vivid, that present things
are injured by being compared with them, vivid from dearness!</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVE</div>

<p>Love, a myrtle wand, is transformed by the Aaron touch of jealousy into
a serpent so vast as to swallow up every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> stinging woe, and makes
us mourn the exchange.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Love that soothes misfortune and buoys up to virtue&mdash;the pillow of
sorrows, the wings of virtue.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Disappointed love not uncommonly causes misogyny, even as extreme thirst
is supposed to be the cause of hydrophobia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUTY AND EXPERIENCE</div>

<p>From the narrow path of virtue Pleasure leads us to more flowery fields,
and there Pain meets and chides our wandering. Of how many pleasures, of
what lasting happiness, is Pain the parent and Woe the womb!</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Real pain can alone cure us of imaginary ills. We feel a thousand
miseries till we are lucky enough to feel misery.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Misfortunes prepare the heart for the enjoyment of happiness in a better
state. The life of a religious benevolent man is an April day. His pains
and sorrows [what are they but] the fertilising rain? The sunshine
blends with every shower, and look! how full and lovely it lies on
yonder hill!</p>

<p>Our quaint metaphysical opinions, in an hour of anguish, are like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

<p>Human happiness, like the aloe, is a flower of slow growth.</p>

<p>Peculiar, not far-fetched; natural, but not obvious; delicate, not
affected; dignified, not swelling; fiery, but not mad; rich in imagery,

perspicuity and conciseness. Thought is the body of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> an ode,
enthusiasm the soul, and imagery the drapery.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Dr. Darwin's poetry is nothing but a succession of landscapes or

rapidity necessary to pathos.</p>

<p>The elder languages were fitter for poetry because they expressed only
prominent ideas with clearness, the others but darkly.... Poetry gives
most pleasure when only generally and not perfectly understood. It was
so by me with Gray's "Bard" and Collins' Odes. The "Bard" once
intoxicated me, and now I read it without pleasure. From this cause it
is that what I call metaphysical poetry gives me so much delight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EGOTISM January 1801</div>

<p>Empirics are boastful and egotists because they introduce real or
apparent novelty, which excites great opposition, [while] personal
opposition creates re-action (which is of course a consciousness of
power) associated with the person re-acting. Paracelsus was a boaster,
it is true; so were the French Jacobins, and Wolff, though not a
boaster, was persecuted into a habit of egotism in his philosophical
writings; so Dr. John Brown, and Milton in his prose works; and those,
in similar circumstances, who, from prudence, abstain from egotism in
their writings are still egotists among their friends. It would be
unnatural effort not to be so, and egotism in such cases is by no means
offensive to a kind and discerning man.</p>

<p>Some flatter themselves that they abhor egotism, and do not suffer it to
appear <i>primâ facie</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> either in their writings or conversation, however
much and however personally they or their opinions have been opposed.
What now? Observe, watch those men; their habits of feeling and thinking
are made up of <i>contempt</i>, which is the concentrated vinegar of
egotism&mdash;it is <i>l&aelig;titia mixta cum odio</i>, a notion of the weakness of
another conjoined with a notion of our own comparative strength, though
that weakness is still strong enough to be troublesome to us, though not
formidable.</p>

distinct and opposite things. Now let me think of <i>myself</i>, of the

<p>Monday, April 1801, and Tuesday, read two works of Giordano Bruno, with
one title-page: <i>Jordani Bruni Nolani de Monade, Numero et Figurâ liber
consequens. Quinque de Minimo, Magno et Mensurâ. Item. De
Innumerabilibus Immenso, et Infigurabili seu de Universo et Mundis libri
octo. Francofurti, Apud Joan. Wechelum et Petrum Fischerum consortes</i>,
1591.</p>

<p>Then follows the dedication, then the index of contents of the whole
volume, at the end of which index is a Latin ode, conceived with great
dignity and grandeur of thought. Then the work <i>De Monade, Numero et
Figurâ, secretioris nempe Physic&aelig;, Mathematic&aelig;, et Metaphysic&aelig; elementa</i>
commences, which, as well as the eight books <i>De Innumerabili</i>, &amp;c., is
a poem in Latin hexameters, divided (each book) into chapters, and to
each chapter is affixed a prose commentary. If the five books <i>de
Minimo</i>, &amp;c., to which this book is consequent are of the same
character, I lost nothing in not having it. As to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> the work <i>De Monade</i>,
it was far too numerical, lineal and Pythagorean for my comprehension.
It read very much like Thomas Taylor and Proclus, &amp;c. I by no means
think it certain that there is no meaning in these works. Nor do I
presume even to suppose that the meaning is of no value (till I
understand a man's ignorance I presume myself ignorant of his
understanding), but it is for others, at present, not for me. Sir P.
Sidney and Fulk Greville shut the doors at their philosophical
conferences with Bruno. If his conversation resembled this book, I
should have thought he would have talked with a trumpet.</p>

<p>The poems and commentaries, in the <i>De Immenso et Innumerabili</i> are of a
different character. The commentary is a very sublime enunciation of the
dignity of the human soul, according to the principles of Plato.</p>

<p>[Here follows the passage, "<i>Anima Sapiens &mdash;&mdash;ubique totus</i>," quoted in
<i>The Friend</i> (<i>Coleridge's Works</i>, ii. 109), together with a brief
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of Bruno's other works. See, too, <i>Biographia Literaria</i>,

him, and he wrote, at times, too much with a sectarian spirit, in a sort

right onward; it is all open ocean and a steady breeze, and he drives

yellows with the deepest crimsons and the infinite shades of brown and
green, the <i>infinite</i> diversity of which blends the whole, so that the

Little woolpacks of white bright vapour rest on different summits and
declivities. The vale is narrowed by the mist and cloud, yet through the
wall of mist you can see into a bower of sunny light, in Borrowdale; the

and the decaying foliage were flowers and blossoms. The pillar of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">THE ORIGIN OF EVIL Thursday October 27, 1803</div>

<p>I sate for my picture [to Hazlitt]&mdash;heard from Southey the "Institution
of the Jesuits," during which some interesting idea occurred to me, and
has escaped. I made out, however, the whole business of the origin of
evil satisfactorily to my own mind, and forced H. to confess that the
metaphysical argument reduced itself to this, Why did not infinite Power
<i>always exclusively</i> produce such beings as in each moment of their
duration were infinite? why, in short, did not the Almighty create an
absolutely infinite number of Almighties? The hollowness and impiety of
the argument will be felt by considering that, suppose a universal
happiness, a perfection of the moral as well as natural world, still the
whole objection applies just as forcibly as at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> moment. The
malignity of the Deity (I shudder even at the assumption of this
affrightful and Satanic language) is manifested in the creation of
archangels and cherubs and the whole company of pure Intelligences
burning in their unquenchable felicity, equally as in the creation of
Neros and Tiberiuses, of stone and leprosy. Suppose yourself perfectly
happy, yet, according to this argument, you <i>ought</i> to charge God with
malignity for having created you&mdash;your own life and all its comforts are
in the indictment against the Creator&mdash;for surely even a child would be
ashamed to answer, "No! I should still exist, only in that case, instead
of being a man, I should be an infinite being." As if the word <i>I</i> here
had even the remotest semblance of a meaning. Infinitely more absurd
than if I should write the fraction <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> on a slate, then rub it out
with my sponge, and write in the same place the integral number
555,666,879, and then observe that the former figure was <i>greatly</i>
improved by the measure, that <i>it</i> was grown a far finer
figure!&mdash;conceiting a <i>change</i> where there had been positive
substitution. Thus, then, it appears that the sole justification of
those who, offended by the vice and misery of the created world, as far
as we know it, impeach the power and goodness of the Almighty, making
the proper cause of such vice and misery to have been a defect either of
power or goodness&mdash;it appears, I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> that their sole justification
rests on an argument which has nothing to do with vice and misery, as
vice and misery&mdash;on an argument which would hold equally good in heaven
as in hell&mdash;on an argument which it might be demonstrated no human being
in a state of happiness could ever have conceived&mdash;an argument which a
millennium would annihilate, and which yet would hold equally good then
as now! But even in point of metaphysic the whole rests at last on the
conceivable. Now, I appeal to every man's internal consciousness, if he
will but sincerely and in brotherly simplicity silence the bustle of
argument in his mind and the ungenial feelings that mingle with and fill
up the mob, and then ask his own intellect whether, supposing he could
conceive the creation of positively infinite and co-equal beings, and
whether, supposing this not only possible but real, this has exhausted
his notion of <i>creatability</i>? whether the intellect, by an unborn and
original law of its essence, does not demand of infinite power more than
merely infinity of number, infinity of sorts and orders? Let him have
created this infinity of infinites, still there is space in the
imagination for the creation of finites; but instead of these, let him
again create infinites; yet still the same space is left, it is no way
filled up. I feel, too, that the whole rests on a miserable sophism of
applying to an Almighty Being such words as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> <i>all</i>. Why were not <i>all</i>
Gods? But there is no <i>all</i> in creation. It is composed of infinites,
and the imagination, bewildered by heaping infinites on infinites and
wearying of demanding increase of number to a number which it conceives
already infinite, deserted by images and mocked by words, whose sole
substance is the inward sense of difficulty that accompanies all our
notions of infinity applied to numbers&mdash;turns with delight to distinct
images and clear ideas, contemplates a <i>world</i>, an harmonious system,
where an infinity of kinds subsist each in a multitude of individuals
apportionate to its kind in conformity to laws existing in the divine
nature, and therefore in the nature of things. We cannot, indeed,
<i>prove</i> this in any other way than by finding it as impossible to deny
omniform, as eternal, agency to God&mdash;by finding it impossible to
conceive that an omniscient Being should not have a distinct idea of
finite beings, or that distinct ideas in the mind of God should be
without the perfection of real existence, that is, imperfect. But this
is a proof subtle indeed, yet not more so than the difficulty. The
intellect that can start the one can understand the other, if his vices
do not prevent him. Admit for a moment that "conceive" is equivalent to
creation in the divine nature, synonymous with "to beget" (a feeling of
which has given to marriage a mysterious sanctity and sacramental
significance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> the mind of many great and good men)&mdash;admit this, and
all difficulty ceases, all tumult is hushed, all is clear and beautiful.
We sit in the dark, but each by the side of his little fire, in his own
group, and lo! the summit of the distant mountain is smitten with light.
All night long it has dwelt there, and we look at it and know that the
sun is not extinguished, that he is elsewhere bright and vivifying, that
he is coming to us, to make our fires needless; yet, even now, that our
cold and darkness are so called only in comparison with the heat and
light of the coming day, never wholly deserted of the rays.</p>

<p>Dozing, dreamt of Hartley as at his christening&mdash;how, as he was asked
who redeemed him, and was to say, "God the Son," he went on humming and
hawing in one hum and haw (like a boy who knows a thing and will not
make the effort to recollect) so as to irritate me greatly. Awakening
gradually, I was able completely to detect that it was the ticking of my
watch, which lay in the pen-place in my desk, on the round table close
by my ear, and which, in the diseased state of my nerves, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> fretted
on my ears. I caught the fact while Hartley's face and moving lips were
yet before my eyes, and his hum and haw and the ticking of the watch
were each the other, as often happens in the passing off of sleep&mdash;that
curious modification of ideas by each other which is the element of
<i>bulls</i>. I arose instantly and wrote it down. It is now ten minutes past
five.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>To return to the question of evil&mdash;woe to the man to whom it is an
uninteresting question, though many a mind over-wearied by it may shun

those critics who laugh at the discussion of old questions: God, right
and wrong, necessity and arbitrement, evil, &amp;c. No! forsooth, the

constitution to a balloon, change of ministry, or, Which had the best of
it in the parliamentary duel, Wyndham or Sheridan? or, at the best, a
chymical thing [or] whether the new celestial bodies shall be called
planets or asteroids&mdash;something new [it must be], something out of
themselves&mdash;for whatever is <i>in</i> them is deep within them&mdash;must be old
as elementary nature [but] to find no contradiction in the union of old
and novel&mdash;to contemplate the Ancient of Days with feelings new as if
they <i>then</i> sprang forth at His own Fiat&mdash;this marks the mind that feels
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> riddle of the world, and may help to unravel it. But to return to
the question. The whole rests on the sophism of imaginary change in a
case of positive substitution. This, I fully believe, settles the
question. The assertion that there is in the essence of the divine
nature a necessity of omniform harmonious action, and that order and
system (not number&mdash;in itself base, disorderly and irrational) define
the creative energy, determine and employ it, and that number is
subservient to order, regulated, organised, made beautiful and rational,
an object both of imagination and intellect by order&mdash;this is no mere
assertion, it is strictly in harmony with the fact. For the world
appears so, and it is proved by whatever proves the being of God.
Indeed, it is involved in the idea of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE VISIONS OF THE NIGHT Nov. 2, 1803, Wednesday morning,
20 minutes past 2 o'clock</div>

<p>The voice of the Greta and the cock-crowing. The voice seems to grow
like a flower on or about the water beyond the bridge, while the
cock-crowing is nowhere particular&mdash;it is at any place I imagine and do
not distinctly see. A most remarkable sky! the moon, now waned to a
perfect ostrich egg, hangs over our house almost, only so much beyond
it, garden-ward, that I can see it, holding my head out of the smaller
study window. The sky is covered with whitish and with dingy cloudage,
thin dingiest scud close under the moon, and one side of it moving, all
else moveless; but there are two great breaks of blue sky, the one
stretches over our house and away toward Castlerigg, and this is
speckled and blotched with white cloud; the other hangs over the road,
in the line of the road, in the shape of an ellipse or shuttle, I do not
know what to call it&mdash;this is unspeckled, all blue, three stars in
it&mdash;more in the former break, all unmoving. The water leaden-white, even
as the grey gleam of water is in latest twilight. Now while I have been
writing this and gazing between-whiles (it is forty minutes past two),
the break over the road is swallowed up, and the stars gone; the break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
over the house is narrowed into a rude circle, and on the edge of its
circumference one very bright star. See! already the white mass,
thinning at its edge, <i>fights</i> with its brilliance. See! it has bedimmed
it, and now it is gone, and the moon is gone. The cock-crowing too has
ceased. The Greta sounds on for ever. But I hear only the ticking of my
watch in the pen-place of my writing-desk and the far lower note of the
noise of the fire, perpetual, yet seeming uncertain. It is the low voice
of quiet change, of destruction doing its work by little and little.</p>

<p>The town, with lighted windows and noise of the <i>clogged</i> passengers in
the streets&mdash;sound of the unseen river. Mountains scarcely perceivable
except by eyes long used to them, and supported by the images of memory
flowing in on the impulses of immediate impression. On the sky, black
clouds; two or three dim, untwinkling stars, like full stops on damp
paper, and large stains and spreads of sullen white, like a tunic of
white wool seen here and there through a torn and tattered cloak of
black. Whence do these stains of white proceed all over the sky, so long
after sunset, and from their indifference of place in the sky, seemingly
unaffected by the west?</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">November 10, 1/2 past 2 o'clock, morning</div>

<p>Awoke, after long struggles, from a persecuting dream. The tale of the
dream began in two <i>images</i>, in two sons of a nobleman, desperately fond
of shooting, brought out by the footman to resign their property, and to
be made believe that they had none. They were far too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> cunning for that,
and as they struggled and resisted their cruel wrongers, and my interest
for them, I suppose, increased, I became they&mdash;the duality
vanished&mdash;Boyer and Christ's Hospital became concerned; yet, still, the
former story was kept up, and I was conjuring him, as he met me in the
street, to have pity on a nobleman's orphan, when I was carried up to
bed, and was struggling up against some unknown impediment&mdash;when a noise
of one of the doors awoke me. Drizzle; the sky uncouthly marbled with
white vapours and large black clouds, their surface of a fine woolly
grain, but in the height and key-stone of the arch a round space of sky
with dim watery stars, like a friar's crown; the seven stars in the
central seen through white vapour that, entirely shapeless, gave a
whiteness to the circle of the sky, but stained with exceedingly thin
and subtle flakes of black vapour, might be happily said in language of
Boccace (describing Demogorgon, in his <i>Genealogia De Gli Dei</i>) to be
<i>vestito d'una pallidezza affumicata</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuesday night, 1/4 after 7</div>

<p>The sky covered with stars, the wind up&mdash;right opposite my window, over
Brandelhow, as its centre, and extending from the gorge to Whinlatter,
an enormous black cloud, exactly in the shape of an egg&mdash;this, the only
cloud in all the sky, impressed me with a demoniacal grandeur. O for
change of weather!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sunday morning, Nov. 13, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> past 2</div>

<p>The sky, in upon Grysdale Pike and onward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> to the Withop Fells, floored
with flat, smooth, dark or dingy clouds, elsewhere starry. Though seven
stars and all the rest in the height of the heaven be dimmed, those in
the descent bright and frosty. The river has a loud voice,
self-biographer of to-day's rain and thunder-showers. The owls are
silent; they have been very musical. All weathers on Saturday the
twelfth, storm and frost, sunshine, lightning and what not! God be
praised, though sleepless, am marvellously bettered, and I take it for
granted that the barometer has risen. I have been reading Barrow's
treatise "On the Pope's Supremacy," and have made a note on the
<i>L'Estrangeism</i> of his style whenever his thoughts rendered it possible
for the words to be pert, frisky and vulgar&mdash;which, luckily, could not
be often, from the gravity of his subjects, the solidity and
appropriateness of his thoughts, and that habitual geometrical
<i>precision</i> of mind which demanded the most <i>appropriate</i> words. He

<div class="sidenote">AN OPTICAL ILLUSION</div>

<p>A pretty optical fact occurred this morning. As I was returning from
Fletcher's, up the back lane and just in sight of the river, I saw,
floating high in the air, somewhere over Mr. Banks', a noble kite. I
continued gazing at it for some time, when, turning suddenly round, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
saw at an equi-distance on my right, that is, over the middle of our
field, a pair of kites floating about. I looked at them for some
seconds, when it occurred to me that I had never before seen two kites
together, and instantly the vision disappeared. It was neither more nor
less than two pair of leaves, each pair on a separate stalk, on a young
fruit tree that grew on the other side of the wall, not two yards from
my eye. The leaves being alternate, did, when I looked at them as
leaves, strikingly resemble wings, and they were the only leaves on the
tree. The magnitude was given by the imagined distance, that distance by
the former adjustment of the eye, which <i>remained</i> in consequence of the
deep impression, the length of time I had been looking at the kite, the
pleasure, &amp;c., and [the fact that] a new object [had] impressed itself
on the eye.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">THE INWARD LIGHT</div>

<p>In Plotinus the system of the Quakers is most beautifully expressed in
the fifth book of the Fifth Ennead (he is speaking of "the inward
light"): "It is not lawful to enquire from whence it originated, for it
neither approached hither, nor again departs from hence to some other
place, but it either appears to us, or does not appear. So that we ought
not to pursue it as if with a view of discerning its latent original,
but to abide in quiet till it suddenly shines upon us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> preparing
ourselves for the blessed spectacle, like the eye waiting for the rising
sun."</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">PARS ALTERA MEI</div>

<p>My nature requires another nature for its support, and reposes only in
another from the necessary indigence of its being. Intensely similar yet
not the same [must that other be]; or, may I venture to say, the same
indeed, but dissimilar, as the same breath sent with the same force, the
same pauses, and the same melody pre-imaged in the mind, into the flute
and the clarion shall be the same <i>soul diversely incarnate</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">NOT THE BEAUTIFUL BUT THE GOOD</div>

<p>"ALL things desire that which is first from a necessity of nature,
prophesying, as it were, that they cannot subsist without the energies
of that first nature. But beauty is not first, it happens only to
intellect, and creates restlessness and seeking; but good, which is
present from the beginning and unceasingly to our innate appetite,
abides with us even in sleep, and never seizes the mind with
astonishment, and requires no peculiar reminiscence to convince us of
its presence."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Plotinus</span>.</p>

<p>This is just and profound, yet perfect beauty being an abstract of good,
in and for that particular form excites in me no passion but that of an
admiration so quiet as scarcely to admit of the name <i>passion</i>, but one
that, participating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> in the same root of soul, does yet spring up with
excellences that I have not. To this I am driven by a desire of
self-completion with a restless and inextinguishable love. God is not
all things, for in this case He would be indigent of all; but all things
are God, and eternally indigent of God. And in the original meaning of
the word <i>essence</i> as predicable of that concerning which you can say,
This is he, or That is he (this or that rather than any other), in this
sense of the word essence, I perfectly coincide with the Platonists and
Plotinists that, if we add to the nature of God either essence or
intellect or beauty, we deprive Him of being the Good himself, the only
One, the purely and absolutely One.</p>

various colours, and belong to their mountains and have nothing to do

<p>4. The excess of humanity and disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>ness in polite
society, the desire not to give pain, for example, not to talk
of your own diseases and misfortunes, and to introduce nothing
but what will give pleasure, destroy all humanity and
disinterestedness, by making it intolerable, through desuetude,
to listen to the complaints of our equals, or of any, where the
listening does not gratify or excite some vicious pride and
sense of superiority.</p>

<p>5. It is difficult to say whether a perfectly unheard-of
subject or a <i>crambe bis cocta</i>, if chosen by a man of genius,
would excite in the higher degree the sense of novelty. Take,
as an instance of the latter, the "Orestes" of Sotheby.</p>

<p>6. Dark with excess of light.</p>

<p>7. Self-absorption and worldly-mindedness (N.B.&mdash;The latter a

<p>The soul within the body&mdash;can I, any way, compare this to the reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the fire seen through my window on the solid wall, seeming, of
course, within the solid wall, as deep within as the distance of the
fire from the wall. I fear I can make nothing out of it; but why do I
always hurry away from any interesting thought to do something
uninteresting? As, for instance, when this thought struck me, I turned
off my attention suddenly and went to look for the copy of Wolff which I
had missed. Is it a cowardice of all deep feeling, even though
pleasurable? or is it laziness? or is it something less obvious than
either? Is it connected with my epistolary embarrassments?</p>

psy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>chologically, not physically, what it is in us, not what the
supposed mundane cause may be. I believe that what we call <i>motion</i> is
our consciousness of motion arising from the interruption of motion, the
action of the soul in suffering resistance. Free unresisted action, the
going forth of the soul, life without consciousness, is, properly,
infinite, that is unlimited. For whatever resists limits, and whatever
is unresisted is unlimited. This, psychologically speaking, is space,
while the sense of resistance or limitation is time, and motion is a
synthesis of the two. The closest approach of time to space forms
co-existent multitude.</p>

<p>I had begun and found it pleasant. Why did I neglect it? Because I ought
not to have done this. The same applies to the reading and writing of
letters, essays, etc. Surely this is well worth a serious analysis,
that, by understanding, I may attempt to heal it. For it is a deep and
wide disease in my moral nature, at once elm-and-oak-rooted. Is it love
of liberty, of spontaneity or what? These all express, but do not
explain the fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tuesday morning, January 10, 1804</div>

<p>After I had got into bed last night I said to myself that I had been
pompously enunciating as a difficulty, a problem of easy and common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
solution&mdash;viz., that it was the effect of association. From infancy up
to manhood, under parents, schoolmasters, inspectors, etc., our
pleasures and pleasant self-chosen pursuits (self-chosen because
pleasant, and not originally pleasant because self-chosen) have been
forcibly interrupted, and dull, unintelligible rudiments, or painful
tasks imposed upon us instead. Now all duty is felt as a <i>command</i>, and
every command is of the nature of an offence. Duty, therefore, by the
law of association being felt as a command from without, would naturally
call up the sensation of the pain roused from the commands of parents
and schoolmasters. But I awoke this morning at half-past one, and as
soon as disease permitted me to think at all, the shallowness and
sophistry of this solution flashed upon me at once. I saw that the
phenomenon occurred far, far too early: I have observed it in infants of
two or three months old, and in Hartley I have seen it turned up and
layed bare to the unarmed eye of the merest common sense. The fact is
that interruption of itself is painful, because and as far as it acts as
<i>disruption</i>. And thus without any reference to or distinct recollection
of my former theory I saw great reason to attribute the effect, wholly,
to the streamy nature of the associative faculty, and the more, as it is
evident that they labour under this defect who are most reverie-ish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> and
streamy&mdash;Hartley, for instance, and myself. This seems to me no common
corroboration of my former thought or the origin of moral evil in
general.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To J. Tobin, Esq., April 10, 1804.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Men who habitually enjoy robust health have, too generally, the trick,
and a very cruel one it is, of imagining that they discover the secret
of all their acquaintances' ill health in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> some malpractice or other;
and, sometimes, by gravely asserting this, here there and everywhere (as
who likes his penetration [hid] under a bushel?), they not only do all
they can, without intending it, to deprive the poor sufferer of that
sympathy which is always a comfort and, in some degree, a support to
human nature, but, likewise, too often implant serious alarm and
uneasiness in the minds of the person's relatives and his nearest and
dearest connections. Indeed (but that I have known its inutility, that I
should be ridiculously sinning against my own law which I was
propounding, and that those who are most fond of advising are the least
able to hear advice from others, as the passion to command makes men
disobedient) I should often have been on the point of advising you
against the two-fold rage of advising and of discussing character, both
the one and the other of which infallibly generates presumption and
blindness to our own faults. Nay! more particularly where, from whatever
cause, there exists a slowness to understand or an aptitude to mishear
and consequently misunderstand what has been said, it too often renders
an otherwise truly good man a mischief-maker to an extent of which he is
but little aware. Our friends' reputation should be a religion to us,
and when it is lightly sacrificed to what self-adulation calls a love of
telling the truth (in reality a lust of talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>ing something seasoned with
the cayenne and capsicum of personality), depend upon it, something in
the heart is warped or warping, more or less according to the greater or
lesser power of the counteracting causes. I confess to you, that being
exceedingly low and heart-fallen, I should have almost sunk under the
operation of reproof and admonition (the whole too, in my conviction,
grounded on utter mistake) at the moment I was quitting, perhaps for
ever! my dear country and all that makes it so dear&mdash;but the high esteem
I cherish towards you, and my sense of your integrity and the reality of
your attachment and concern blows upon me refreshingly as the sea-breeze
on the tropic islander. Show me anyone made better by blunt advice, and
I may abate of my dislike to it, but I have experienced the good effects
of the contrary in Wordsworth's conduct to me; and, in Poole and others,
have witnessed enough of its ill effects to be convinced that it does
little else but harm both to the adviser and the advisee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLACES AND PERSONS, Thursday, April 19, 1804</div>

<p>This is Spain! That is Africa! Now, then, I have seen Africa! &amp;c., &amp;c.
O! the power of names to give interest. When I first sate down, with
Europe on my left and Africa on my right, both distinctly visible, I
felt a quickening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> movements in the blood, but still it felt as a
pleasure of <i>amusement</i> rather than of thought or elevation; and at the
same time, and gradually winning on the other, the nameless silent forms
of nature were working in me, like a tender thought in a man who is
hailed merrily by some acquaintance in his work, and answers it in the
same tone. This is Africa! That is Europe! There is <i>division</i>, sharp
boundary, abrupt change! and what are they in nature? Two mountain banks
that make a noble river of the interfluent sea, not existing and acting
with distinctness and manifoldness indeed, but at once and as one&mdash;no
division, no change, no antithesis! Of all men I ever knew, Wordsworth
himself not excepted, I have the faintest pleasure in things contingent
and transitory. I never, except as a forced courtesy of conversation,
ask in a stage-coach, Whose house is that? nor receive the least
additional pleasure when I receive the answer. Nay, it goes to a disease
in me. As I was gazing at a wall in Caernarvon Castle, I wished the
guide fifty miles off that was telling me, In this chamber the Black
Prince was born (or whoever it was). I am not certain whether I should
have seen with any emotion the mulberry-tree of Shakspere. If it were a
tree of no notice in itself, I am sure that I should feel by an
effort&mdash;with self-reproach at the dimness of the feeling; if a striking
tree, I fear that the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> would be diminished rather than
increased, that I should have no unity of feeling, and find in the
constant association of Shakspere having planted it an intrusion that
prevented me from wholly (as a whole man) losing myself in the flexures
of its branches and intertwining of its roots. No doubt there are times
and conceivable circumstances in which the contrary would be true, in
which the thought that under this rock by the sea-shore I know that
Giordano Bruno hid himself from the pursuit of the enraged priesthood,
and overcome with the power and sublimity of the truths for which they
sought his life, thought his life therefore given him that he might bear
witness to the truths, and <i>morti ultra occurrens</i>, returned and
surrendered himself! So, here, on this bank Milton used to lie, in late
May, when a young man, and familiar with all its primroses, made them
yet dearer than their dear selves, by that sweetest line in the Lycidas,
"And the rathe primrose that forsaken dies:" or from this spot the
immortal deer-stealer, on his escape from Warwickshire, had the first
view of London, and asked himself, And what am I to do there? At certain
times, uncalled and sudden, subject to no bidding of my own or others,
these thoughts would come upon me like a storm, and fill the place with
something more than nature. But these are not contingent or transitory,
they are nature, even as the elements are nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>&mdash;yea, more to the
human mind, for the mind has the power of abstracting all agency from
the former and considering [them] as mere effects and instruments. But a
Shakspere, a Milton, a Bruno, exist in the mind as pure <i>action</i>,
defecated of all that is material and passive. And the great moments
that formed them&mdash;it is a kind of impiety against a voice within us, not
to regard them as predestined, and therefore things of now, for ever,
and which were always. But it degrades the sacred feeling, and is to it
what stupid superstition is to enthusiastic religion, when a man makes a
pilgrimage to see a great man's shin-bone found unmouldered in his
coffin. Perhaps the matter stands thus. I could feel amused by these
things, and should be, if there had not been connected with the great
name upon which the amusement wholly depends a higher and deeper
pleasure, that will [not] endure the co-presence of so mean a companion;
while the mass of mankind, whether from nature or (as I fervently hope)
from error of rearing and the worldliness of their after-pursuits, are
rarely susceptible of any other pleasures than those of <i>amusement</i>,
gratification of curiosity, novelty, surprise, wonderment, from the
glaring, the harshly-contrasted, the odd, the accidental, and find the
reading of the <i>Paradise Lost</i> a task somewhat alleviated by a few
entertaining incidents, such as the pandemonium and self-en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>dwarfment of
the devils, the fool's paradise and the transformation of the infernal
court into serpents and of their intended applauses into hisses.</p>

pleasure of communicating thy thoughts and awaking sympathy, but not
even by the always mixed hope of producing conviction. This is not the

by modestly and most truly saying, "Your arguments are all consequent,

will be a business for moments of thought, for a Sabbath-day of your
existence. Then, perhaps, a voice from within will say to you, better,

<p>Each man having a spark (to use the old metaphor) of the Divinity, yet a
whole fire-grate of humanity&mdash;each, therefore, will legislate for the
whole, and spite of the <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>, even in
trifles&mdash;and, till corrected by experience, at least, in this endless
struggle of presumption, really occasioned by the ever-working spark of
the Universal, in the disappointments and baffled attempts of each, all
are disposed to [admit] the <i>jus extrinsecum</i> of Spinoza, and recognise
that reason as the highest which may not be understood as the best, but
of which the concrete possession is felt to be the strongest. Then come
society, habit, education, misery, intrigue, oppression, then
<i>revolution</i>, and the circle begins anew. Each man will universalise his
notions, and, yet, each is variously finite. To <i>reconcile</i>, therefore,
is truly the work of the inspired! This is the true <i>Atonement</i>&mdash;that
is, to reconcile the struggles of the infinitely various finite with the
<i>permanent</i>.</p>

<p>Do not be too much discouraged, if any virtue <i>should</i> be mixed, in your

<i>Probatum est</i>. Disapprove, be <i>ashamed</i> of the thought, of its always

all virtue subsists in and by pleasure. S. T. C. Sunday evening, October

<p>When you are harassed, disquieted, and have little dreams of resentment,

treatment and strange misconceptions and illogicalities, palpably from
bad passion, in any person connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> you, suspect a sympathy in
yourself with some of these bad passions&mdash;vanity, for instance. Though a
sense of wounded justice is possible, nay, probably, forms a part of
your uneasy feelings, yet this of itself would yield, at the first
moment of reflection, to pity for the wretched state of a man too
untranquil and perpetually selfish to love anything for itself or
without some end of vanity or ambition&mdash;who detests all poetry, tosses
about in the impotence of desires disproportionate to his powers, and
whose whole history of his whole life is a tale of disappointment in
circumstances where the hope and pretension was always unwise, often
presumptuous and insolent. Surely an intuition of this restless and
no-end-having mood of mind would at once fill a hearer having no
sympathy with these passions with tender melancholy, virtuously mixed
with grateful unpharisaic self-complacency. But a patient <i>almost</i>, but
not quite, recovered from madness, yet on its confines, finds in the
notions of madness that which irritates and haunts and makes unhappy.</p>

&amp;c.&mdash;they would, and to a certain extent do, supply each other's place.
The air-vessels of fish and of insects are analogous to lungs&mdash;the end
the same, however different the means. No one would say, "Lungs are
analogous to lungs," and it seems to me either inaccurate or involving
some true conception obscurely, when we speak of planets by analogy of
ours&mdash;for here, knowing nothing but likeness, we presume the difference
from the remoteness and difficulty, in the vulgar apprehension, of
considering those pin-points as worlds. So, likewise, instead of the
phrase "analogy of the past," applied to historical reasoning, nine
times out of ten I should say, "by the example of the past." This may
appear verbal trifling, but "<i>animadverte quam sit ab improprietate
verborum pronum hominibus prolabi in errores circa res</i>." In short,
analogy always implies a difference in kind and not merely in degree.
There is an analogy between dimness and numbness and a certain state of
the sense of hearing correspondent to these, which produces confusion
with <i>magnification</i>, for which we have no name. But between light green

<p>Think of all this as an absolute revelation, a real presence of Deity,

revelations&mdash;the material and the moral&mdash;and the former is not to be
seen but by the latter. As St. Paul has so well observed: "By worldly
wisdom no man ever arrived at God;" but having seen Him by the moral
sense, then we <i>understand</i> the outward world. Even as with books, no
book of itself teaches a language in the first instance; but having by
sympathy of soul learnt it, we then understand the book&mdash;that is, the
<i>Deus minor</i> in His work.</p>

the ever-perishing white-water wavehead, that the eye was unable to
detect the illusion which the mind delighted to indulge in. O that sky,

plain&mdash;what an awful omneity in unity! I know no other perfect union of
the sublime with the beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> so that they should be felt, that is,
at the same minute, though by different faculties, and yet, each faculty
be predisposed, by itself, to receive the specific modifications from
the other. To the eye it is an inverted goblet, the inside of a sapphire
basin, perfect beauty in shape and colour. To the mind, it is immensity;
but even the eye feels as if it were [able] to look through with [a] dim
sense of the non-resistance&mdash;it is not exactly the feeling given to the
organ by solid and limited things, [but] the eye feels that the
limitation is in its own power, not in the object. But [hereafter] to

should feel in actual travelling horizontally or in direct ascent,
<i>that</i> we feel in fancy. For what are our feelings of this kind but a
motion imagined, [together] with the feelings that would accompany that
motion, [but] less distinguished, more blended, more rapid, more
confused, and, thereby, co-adunated? Just as white is the very emblem of

<div class="sidenote">HIS CONVERSATION, A NIMIETY OF IDEAS, NOT OF WORDS</div>

<p>There are two sorts of talkative fellows whom it would be injurious to
confound, and I, S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge, am the latter. The first sort is of
those who use five hundred words more than needs to express an
idea&mdash;that is not my case. Few men, I will be bold to say, put more
meaning into their words than I, or choose them more deliberately and
discriminately. The second sort is of those who use five hundred more
ideas, images, reasons, &amp;c., than there is any need of to arrive at
their object, till the only object arrived at is that the mind's eye of
the bystander is dazzled with colours succeeding so rapidly as to leave
one vague impression that there has been a great blaze of colours all
about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> something. Now this is my case, and a grievous fault it is. My
illustrations swallow up my thesis. I feel too intensely the
omnipresence of all in each, platonically speaking; or, psychologically,
my brain-fibres, or the spiritual light which abides in the
brain-marrow, as visible light appears to do in sundry rotten mackerel
and other <i>smashy</i> matters, is of too general an affinity with all
things, and though it perceives the <i>difference</i> of things, yet is
eternally pursuing the likenesses, or, rather, that which is common
[between them]. Bring me two things that seem the very same, and then I
am quick enough [not only] to show the difference, even to
hair-splitting, but to go on from circle to circle till I break against
the shore of my hearers' patience, or have my concentricals dashed to
nothing by a snore. That is my ordinary mishap. At Malta, however, no
one can charge me with one or the other. I have earned the general
character of being a quiet well-meaning man, rather dull indeed! and who
would have thought that he had been a <i>poet</i>! "O, a very wretched

One tiny particle combines with another its like, and, so, lengthens and

<div class="sidenote">THE SENSE OF MAGNITUDE Tuesday, Jan. 15, 1805</div>

<p>This evening there was the most perfect and the brightest halo circling
the roundest and brightest moon I ever beheld. So bright was the halo,
so compact, so entire a circle, that it gave the whole of its area, the
moon itself included, the appearance of a solid opaque body, an enormous
planet. It was as if this planet had a circular trough of some
light-reflecting fluid for its rim (that is the halo) and its centre
(that is the moon) a small circular basin of some fluid that still more
copiously reflected, or that even emitted light; and as if the
interspatial area were somewhat equally substantial but sullen. Thence I
have found occasion to meditate on the nature of the sense of magnitude
and its absolute dependence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> idea of <i>substance</i>; the consequent
difference between magnitude and spaciousness, the dependence of the
idea on double-touch, and thence to evolve all our feelings and ideas of
magnitude, magnitudinal sublimity, &amp;c., from a scale of our own bodies.
For why, if form constituted the sense, that is, if it were pure vision,
as a perceptive sense abstracted from <i>feeling</i> in the organ of vision,
why do I seek for mountains, when in the flattest countries the clouds
present so many and so much more romantic and <i>spacious</i> forms, and the
coal-fire so many, so much more varied and lovely forms? And whence
arises the pleasure from musing on the latter? Do I not, more or less
consciously, fancy myself a Lilliputian to whom these would be
mountains, and so, by this factitious scale, make them mountains, my
pleasure being consequently playful, a voluntary poem in hieroglyphics
or picture-writing&mdash;"<i>phantoms</i> of sublimity," which I continue to know
to be <i>phantoms</i>? And form itself, is not its main agency exerted in
individualising the thing, making it <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>, and thereby
facilitating the shadowy measurement of it by the scale of my own body?</p>

<p>Yon long, not unvaried, ridge of hills, that runs out of sight each way,
it is <i>spacious</i>, and the pleasure derivable from it is from its
<i>running</i>, its <i>motion</i>, its assimilation to action; and here the scale
is taken from my life and soul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> not from my body. Space is the
Hebrew name for God, and it is the most perfect image of <i>soul, pure
soul</i>, being to us nothing but unresisted action. Whenever action is
resisted, limitation begins&mdash;and limitation is the first constituent of
body&mdash;the more omnipresent it is in a given space, the more that space
is <i>body</i> or matter&mdash;and thus all body necessarily presupposes soul,
inasmuch as all resistance presupposes action. Magnitude, therefore, is
the intimate blending, the most perfect union, through its whole sphere,
in every minutest part of it, of action and resistance to action. It is
spaciousness in which space is filled up&mdash;that is, as we well say,
transmitted by incorporate accession, not destroyed. In all limited
things, that is, in <i>all forms</i>, it is at least fantastically stopped,
and, thus, from the positive <i>grasp</i> to the mountain, from the mountain
to the cloud, from the cloud to the blue depth of sky, which, as on the
top of Etna, in a serene atmosphere, seems to go <i>behind</i> the sun, all
is <i>graduation</i>, that precludes division, indeed, but not distinction;
and he who endeavours to overturn a distinction by showing that there is
no chasm, by the old sophism of the <i>cumulus</i> or the horse's tail, is
still diseased with the <i>formication</i>,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> the (what is the nosological

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND POETRY Feb. 4, 1805</div>

<p>I cannot admit that any language can be unfit for poetry, or that there
is any language in which a divinely inspired architect may not sustain
the lofty edifice of verse on its two pillars of sublimity and pathos.
Yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> have heard Frenchmen, nay, even Englishmen, assert that of the
German, which contains perhaps an hundred passages equal to the&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Und ein Gott ist, ein heiliger Wille lebt,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wie auch der menschliche wanke;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and I have heard both German and Englishmen (and these, too, men of true
feeling and genius, and so many of them that such company of my betters
makes me not ashamed to the having myself been guilty of this injustice)
assert that the French language is insusceptible of poetry in its higher
and purer sense, of poetry which excites emotion not merely creates
amusement, which demands continuous admiration, not regular recurrence
of conscious surprise, and the effect of which is love and joy.
Unfortunately the manners, religion and government of France, and the
circumstances of its emergence from the polyarchy of feudal barony, have
given a bad taste to the Parisians&mdash;so bad a one as doubtless to have
mildewed many an opening blossom. I cannot say that I know and can name
any one French writer that can be placed among the greater poets, but
when I read the inscription over the Chartreuse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">C'est ici que la Mort et la Verit&eacute;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">C'est de cette demeure au monde inaccessible<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que l'on passe à l'Eternit&eacute;<br /></span>

<p>I seem to feel that if France had been for ages a Protestant nation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a Milton had been born in it, the French language would not have
precluded the production of a "Paradise Lost," though it might, perhaps,
that of a Hamlet or a Lear.</p>

<p>This abstract self is, indeed, in its nature a Universal personified, as
Life, Soul, Spirit, etc. Will not this <i>prove</i> it to be a <i>deeper</i>

and become one with them; whereas the appetites and the feelings of
revenge and anger co-exist with the ideas, not combine with them, and
alter the apparent effect of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> form, not the forms themselves?

<p>It is not without a certain sense of self-reproof, as well as
self-distrust, that I ask, or, rather, that my understanding suggests to
me the query, whether this divine poem (in so original a strain of
thought and feeling honourable to human nature) would not have been more
perfect if the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas had been omitted, and
the tenth and eleventh transposed so as to stand as the third and
fourth. It is not, perhaps not at all, but, certainly, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> principally
that I feel any meanness in the "needles;" but, not to mention that the
words "once a shining store" is a speck in the diamond (in a less dear
poem I might, perhaps, have called it more harshly a <i>rhyme-botch</i>), and
that the word "restless" is rather too strong an impersonation for the
serious tone, the <i>real</i>ness of the poem, and seems to tread too closely
on the mock-heroic; but that it seems not true to poetic feeling to
introduce the affecting circumstance of dimness of sight from decay of
nature on an occasion so remote from the &#964;&#959; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#965;,
and that
the fifth stanza, graceful and even affecting as the spirit of the

feeling, breaks in painfully here&mdash;the age and afflicting infirmities
both of the writer and his subject seem abhorrent from such trifling
of&mdash;scarcely fancy, for I fear, if it were analysed, that the whole
effect would be found to depend on phrases hackneyed, and taken from the
alms-house of the Muses. The test would be this: read the poem to a
well-educated but natural woman, an unaffected, gentle being, endued
with sense and sensibility&mdash;substituting the tenth and eleventh stanzas
for those three, and some days after shew her the poem as it now stands.
I seem to be sure that she would be shocked&mdash;an alien would have
intruded himself, and be found sitting in a circle of dear friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> whom

<div class="sidenote">ETYMOLOGY</div>

<p>To say that etymology is a science&mdash;is to use this word in its laxest
and improper sense. But our language, except, at least, in poetry, has
dropped the word "lore"&mdash;the <i>lehre</i> of the Germans, the <i>logos</i> of the
Greek. Either we should have retained the word and ventured on
<i>Root-lore</i>, <i>verse-lore</i>, etc., or have adopted the Greek as a single
word as well as a word in combination. All novelties appear or are
rather felt as ridiculous in language; but, if it had been once adopted,
it would have been no stranger to have said that etymo<i>logy</i> is a <i>logy</i>
which perishes from a plethora of probability, than that the <i>art</i> of
war is an <i>art</i> apparently for the destruction and subjugation of
particular states, but really for the lessening of bloodshed and the
preservation of the liberties of mankind. Art and Science are both too
much appropriated&mdash;our language wants terms of comprehensive generality,
implying the kind, not the degree or species, as in that good and
necessary word <i>sensuous</i>, which we have likewise dropped, opposed to
sensual, sensitive, sensible, etc., etc. Chymistry has felt this
difficulty, and found the necessity of having one word for the supposed
cause, another for the effect, as in caloric or calorific, opposed to
heat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> and psychology has still more need of the reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SENTIMENT, AN ANTIDOTE TO CASUISTRY</div>

<p>The Queen-bee in the hive of Popish Error, the great mother of the
swarm, seems to me their tenet concerning Faith and Works, placing the
former wholly in the rectitude, nay, in the rightness of intellectual
conviction, and the latter in the definite and, most often, the material
action, and, consequently, the assertion of the dividuous nature and
self-existence of works. Hence the doctrine of damnation out of the
Church of Rome&mdash;of the one visible Church&mdash;of the absolute efficiency
<i>in se</i> of all the Sacraments and the absolute merit of ceremonial
observances. Consider the incalculable advantage of chiefly dwelling on
the virtues of the heart, of habits of feeling and harmonious action,
the music of the adjusted string at the impulse of the breeze, and, on
the other hand, the evils of books concerning particular actions, minute
cases of conscience, hair-splitting directions and decisions, O how
illustrated by the detestable character of most of the Roman Catholic
casuists! No actions should be distinctly described but such as
manifestly tend to awaken the heart to efficient feeling, whether of
fear or of love&mdash;actions that, falling back on the fountain, keep it
full, or clear out the mud from its pipes, and make it play in its
abundance, shining in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> purity in which, at once, the purity and the
light is each the cause of the other, the light purifying, and the

not, like the polished mirror, by reflection from itself, but by

from the deep utter blue of the sky&mdash;a <span class="smcap">MASS</span> of <i>pearl</i>-white cloud

<p>Monday morning, which I ought not to have known not to be Sunday night,
2 o'clock, March 4, 1805.</p>

<p>My dreams to-night were interfused with struggle and fear, though, till
the very last, not victors; but the very last, which awoke me, was a
completed night-mare, as it gave the <i>idea</i> and <i>sensation</i> of actual
grasp or touch contrary to <i>my</i> will and in apparent consequence of the
malignant will of the external form, whether actually appearing or, as
sometimes happened, believed to exist&mdash;in which latter case I have two
or three times felt a horrid touch of hatred, a grasp, or a weight of
hate and horror abstracted from all [conscious] form or supposal of
form, an <i>abstract touch</i>, an <i>abstract</i> grasp, an <i>abstract</i> weight!
<i>Quam nihil ad genium Papiliane tuum!</i> or, in other words, <i>This
Mackintosh would prove to be nonsense by a Scotch smile.</i> The last
[dream], that woke me, though a true night-mare, was, however, a mild
one. I cried out early, like a scarcely-hurt child who knows himself
within hearing of his mother. But, anterior to this, I had been playing
with children, especially with one most lovely child, about two years or
two and a half, and had repeated to her, in my dream, "The dews were
falling fast," &amp;c., and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> was sorely frightened by the sneering and
fiendish malignity of the beautiful creature, but from the beginning
there had been a terror about it and proceeding from it. I shall
hereafter, read the Vision in "Macbeth" with increased admiration.</p>

acquainted with Nature in her detail, we are delighted with <i>distinct</i>,
vivid ideas, and with vivid ideas most when made distinct, and can most
often forgive and sometimes be delighted with even a low image from art

<div class="sidenote">EXPERIENCE AND BOOK KNOWLEDGE Midnight, April 5, 1805</div>

<p>"I will write," I said, "as truly as I can from experience, actual
individual experience, not from book-knowledge." But yet it is wonderful
how exactly the knowledge from good books coincides with the experience
of men of the world. How often, when I was younger, have I noticed the
deep delight of men of the world who have taken late in life to
literature, on coming across a passage the force of which had either
escaped me altogether, or which I knew to be true from books only and at
second hand! Experience is necessary, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> doubt, if only to give a light
and shade in the mind, to give to some one idea a greater vividness than
to others, and thereby to make it a <i>Thing</i> of <i>Time</i> and actual
reality. For all ideas being equally vivid, the whole becomes a dream.
But, notwithstanding this and other reasons, I yet believe that the saws
against book-knowledge are handed down to us from times when books
conveyed only abstract science or abstract morality and religion.
Whereas, in the present day, what is there of real life, in all its
goings on, trades, manufactures, high life, low life, animate and
inanimate that is not to be found in books? In these days books are

My enthusiasm for the happiness of mankind in particular places and

strong letter to my most dear and honoured Wordsworth in consequence of
his "Ode to Duty," and in that letter explained this as the effect of
selfness in a mind incapable of gross self-interest&mdash;I mean, the
decrease of hope and joy, the soul in its round and round flight forming
narrower circles, till at every gyre its wings beat against the

to lay in a larger and more advantageous cargo, but procured you a
voyage to India instead of China, and in this circumstance a next to

<div class="sidenote">LOVE THE DIVINE ESSENCE</div>

<p>The best, the truly lovely in each and all, is God. Therefore the truly
beloved is <i>the symbol of God</i> to whomever it is truly beloved by, but
it may become perfect and maintained love by the function of the two.
The lover worships in his beloved that final consummation of itself
which is produced in his own soul by the action of the soul of the
beloved upon it, and that final perception of the soul of the beloved
which is in part the consequence of the reaction of his (so ameliorated
and regenerated) soul upon the soul of his beloved, till each
contemplates the soul of the other as involving his own, both in its
givings and its receivings, and thus, still keeping alive its <i>outness</i>,
its <i>self-oblivion</i> united with self-warmth, still approximates to God!
Where shall I find an image for this sublime symbol which, ever
involving the presence of Deity, yet tends towards it ever? Shall it be
in the attractive powers of the different surfaces of the earth? each
attraction the vicegerent and representative of the central attraction,
and yet being no other than that attraction itself? By some such feeling
as this I can easily believe the mind of F&eacute;nelon and Madame Guyon to
have coloured its faith in the worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> saints, but that was most
dangerous. It was not idolatry in <i>them</i>, but it encouraged idolatry in

involve this evil, but it multiplies, intensifies the good.</p>

of more solid value, perhaps, than the orange itself! O how the Bees
be-throng and be-murmur it! O how the honey tells the tale of its

<div class="sidenote">THE HOPE OF HUMANITY, Easter Sunday, 1805</div>

<p>That beautiful passage in dear and honoured W. Wordsworth's "Michael,"
respecting the forward-looking Hope inspired pre-eminently by the birth
of a child, was brought to my mind most forcibly by my own independent
though, in part, anticipated reflections on the importance of young
children to the keeping up the stock of Hope in the human species. They
seem to be the immediate and secreting organ of Hope in the great
organised body of the whole human race, in <i>all men</i> considered as the
component atoms of <i>Man</i>&mdash;as young leaves are the organs of supplying
vital air to the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NORTHERN EASTER Easter Sunday, 1805</div>

<p>The English and German climates and that of northern France possess,
among many others, this one little beauty of uniting the mysteries of
positive with those of natural religion&mdash;in celebrating the symbolical
resurrection of the human soul in that of the Crucified, at the time of
the actual resurrection of the "living life" of nature.</p>

<p>Religion consists in truth and virtue, that is, the permanent, the

within. Well, therefore, does the Scripture speak of the Spirit as
praying to the Spirit, "The Lord said to my Lord." God is the essence as
well as the object of religion.</p>

<p>John Tobin dead, and just after the success of his play! and Robert
Allen dead suddenly!</p>

<p>O when we are young we lament for death only by sympathy, or with the
general feeling with which we grieve for misfortunes in general, but
there comes a time (and this year is the time that has come to me) when
we lament for death as death, when it is felt for itself, and as itself,
aloof from all its consequences. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> comes the grave-stone into the
heart with all its mournful names, then the bell-man's or clerk's verses
subjoined to the bills of mortality are no longer common-place.</p>

<p>[John Tobin the dramatist died December 7, 1804. His play entitled "The
Honeymoon" was published in 1805.</p>

<p>Robert Allen, Coleridge's contemporary and school-friend, held the post
of deputy-surgeon to the 2nd Royals, then on service in Portugal. He was
a friend of Dr. (afterwards Sir J.) Stoddart, with whom Coleridge stayed
on his first arrival at Malta. See <i>Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, Macmillan,

<div class="sidenote">LOVE AND DUTY</div>

<p>Würde, worthiness, <span class="smcap">VIRTUE</span>, consist in the mastery over the sensuous and
sensual impulses; but love requires <span class="smcap">INNOCENCE</span>. Let the lover ask his
heart whether he can endure that his mistress should have <i>struggled</i>
with a sensual impulse for another man, though she overcame it from a
sense of duty to him. Women are <span class="smcap">LESS</span> offended with men, in part, from
the vicious habits of men, and, in part, from the difference of bodily
constitution. Yet, still, to a pure and truly loving woman this must be
a painful thought. That he should struggle with and overcome ambition,
desire of fortune, superior beauty, &amp;c., or with objectless desire of
any kind, is pleasing, but <i>not</i> that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> struggled with positive,
appropriated desire, that is, desire <i>with</i> an object. Love, in short,
requires an absolute peace and harmony between all parts of human
nature, such as it is; and it is offended by any <i>war</i>, though the
battle should be decided in favour of the worthier. This is, perhaps,
the final cause of the <i>rarity</i> of true love, and the efficient and
immediate cause of its difficulty. Ours is a life of probation. We are
to contemplate and obey <i>duty</i> for its own sake, and in order to do
this, we, in our present imperfect state of being, must see it not
merely abstracted from but in direct opposition to the <i>wish</i>, the
<i>inclination</i>. Having perfected this, the highest possibility of human
nature, man may then with safety harmonise <i>all</i> his being with this&mdash;he
may <i>love</i>. To perform duties absolutely from the sense of duty is the
<i>ideal</i>, which, perhaps, no human being ever can arrive at, but which
every human being ought to try to draw near unto. This is, in the only
wise, and, verily, in a most sublime sense, to see God face to face,
which, alas! it seems too true that no man can do and <i>live</i>, that is, a
<i>human</i> life. It would become incompatible with his organization, or
rather, it would <i>transmute</i> it, and the process of that transmutation,
to the senses of other men, would be called death. Even as to the
caterpillar, in all probability, the caterpillar dies, and he either,
which is most probable, does not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> (or, at all events, does not see
the connection between the caterpillar and) the butterfly, the beautiful
Psyche of the Greeks.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">HAPPINESS MADE PERFECT</div>

<p>Those who in this life love in perfection, if such there be, in
proportion as their love has no struggles, see God darkly and through a
veil. For when duty and pleasure are absolutely co-incident, the very
nature of our organisation necessitates that duty will be contemplated
as the symbol of pleasure, instead of pleasure being (as in a future
life we have faith it will be) the symbol of duty. For herein lies the
distinction between human and angelic happiness. Humanly happy I call
him who in enjoyment <i>finds</i> his duty; angelically happy he, who seeks
and finds his duty in enjoyment.</p>

<p>Happiness in general may be defined, not the aggregate of pleasurable
sensations&mdash;for this is either a dangerous error and the creed of
sensualists, or else a mere translation or wordy paraphrase&mdash;but the
state of that person who, in order to enjoy his nature in the highest
manifestation of conscious <i>feeling</i>, has no need of doing wrong, and
who, in order to do right, is under no necessity of abstaining from
enjoyment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOUGHT AND THINGS</div>

<p>Thought and reality are, as it were, two distinct corresponding sounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of which no man can say positively which is the voice and which the
echo.</p>

<p>Oh, the beautiful fountain or natural well at Upper Stowey! The images
of the weeds which hung down from its sides appear as plants growing up,
straight and upright, among the water-weeds that really grow from the
bottom of the well, and so vivid was the image, that for some moments,
and not till after I had disturbed the water, did I perceive that their
roots were not neighbours, and they side-by-side companions. So ever,
then I said, so are the happy man's thoughts and things, [or in the
language of the modern philosophers] his ideas and impressions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPERSTITION</div>

<p>The two characteristics which I have most observed in Roman Catholic
mummery processions, baptisms, etc., are, first, the immense <i>noise</i> and
jingle-jingle as if to frighten away the d&aelig;mon common-sense; and,
secondly, the unmoved, stupid, uninterested faces of the conjurers. I
have noticed no exception. Is not the very nature of superstition in
general, as being utterly sensuous, <i>cold</i> except where it is <i>sensual?</i>
Hence the older form of idolatry, as displayed in the Greek mythology,
was, in some sense, even preferable to the Popish. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> whatever life
did and could exist in superstition it brought forward and sanctified in
its rites of Bacchus, Venus, etc. The papist by pretence of suppression
warps and denaturalises. In the pagan [ritual, superstition] burnt with
a bright flame, in the popish it consumes the soul with a smothered fire
that stinks in darkness and smoulders like gum that burns but is
incapable of light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ILLUSION Sunday Midnight, May 12, 1805</div>

<p>At the Treasury, La Valetta, Malta, in the room the windows of which
directly face the piazzas and vast saloon built for the archives and
Library and now used as the Garrison Ball-room, sitting at one corner of
a large parallelogram table well-littered with books, in a red
arm-chair, at the other corner of which (diagonally)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/i144.jpg" width="94" height="33" alt="diagonally" title="" /></div>

<p>Mr. Dennison had been sitting&mdash;he and I having conversed
for a long time, he bade me good night, and retired&mdash;I meaning to retire
too, however sunk for five minutes or so into a doze and on suddenly
awaking up I saw him as distinctly sitting in the chair, as I had,
really, some ten minutes before. I was startled, and thinking of it,
sunk into a second doze, out of which awaking as before I saw again the
same appearance; not more distinct indeed, but more of his form&mdash;for at
the first time I had seen only his face and bust&mdash;but now I saw as much
as I could have seen if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> had been really there. The appearance was
very nearly that of a person seen through thin smoke distinct indeed,
but yet a sort of distinct <i>shape</i> and <i>colour</i>, with a diminished sense
of <i>substantiality</i>&mdash;like a face in a clear stream. My nerves had been
violently agitated yesterday morning by the attack of three dogs as I
was mounting the steps of Captain Pasley's door&mdash;two of them savage
Bedouins, who wounded me in the calf of my left leg. I have noted this
down, not three minutes having intervened since the illusion took place.
Often and often I have had similar experiences and, therefore, resolved
to write down the particulars whenever any new instance should occur, as
a weapon against superstition, and an explanation of ghosts&mdash;Banquo in
"Macbeth" the very same thing. I once told a lady the reason why I did
not believe in the existence of ghosts, etc., was that I had seen too
many of them myself. N.B. There were on the table a common black
wine-bottle, a decanter of water, and, between these, one of the
half-gallon glass flasks which Sir G. Beaumont had given me (four of
these full of port), the cork in, covered with leather, and having a
white plated ring on the top. I mention this because since I wrote the
former pages, on blinking a bit a third time, and opening my eyes, I
clearly <i>detected</i> that this high-shouldered hypochondriacal bottle-man
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> a great share in producing the effect. The metamorphosis was
clearly beginning, though I snapped the spell before it had assumed a
recognisable form. The red-leather arm-chair was so placed at the corner
that the flask was exactly between me and it&mdash;and the lamp being close
to my corner of the large table, and not giving much light, the chair
was rather obscure, and the brass nails where the leather was fastened
to the outward wooden rim reflecting the light more copiously were seen
almost for themselves. What if instead of immediately checking the
sight, and then pleased with it as a philosophical <i>case</i>, I had been
frightened and encouraged it, and my understanding had joined <i>its vote</i>
to that of my senses?</p>

<p>My own shadow, too, on the wall not far from Mr. D.'s chair&mdash;the white
paper, the sheet of Harbour Reports lying spread out on the table on the
other side of the bottles&mdash;influence of mere colour, influence of
shape&mdash;wonderful coalescence of scattered colours at distances, and,
then, all going to some one shape, and the modification! Likewise I am
more convinced by repeated observation that, perhaps, always in a very
minute degree but assuredly in certain states and postures of the eye,
as in drowsiness, in the state of the brain and nerves after distress or
agitation, especially if it had been accompanied by weeping, and in
many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> others, we see our own faces, and project them according to the
distance given them by the degree of indistinctness&mdash;that this may
occasion in the highest degree the Wraith (<i>vide</i> a hundred Scotch
stories, but better than all, Wordsworth's most wonderful and admirable
poem, Peter Bell, when he sees his own figure), and, still oftener, that
it facilitates the formation of a human face out of some really present
object, and from the alteration of the distance among other causes never
suspected as the occasion and substratum.</p>

other. Never goes quite right any one, no two go exactly the same; they

This is a sufficient proof that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> the first admiration was not sound, or
founded on sound distinct perceptions [or, if sprung from], a sound

And now the French stage is to be re-introduced. O Germany! Germany! why

But stop, let me not fall into the pit against which I was about to warn
others. Let me not confound the discriminating character and genius of a
nation with the conflux of its individuals in cities and reviews. Let
England be Sir Philip Sidney, Shakspere, Milton, Bacon, Harrington,
Swift, Wordsworth; and never let the names of Darwin, Johnson, Hume,

England; or, rather, let the first be old England, the spiritual,

<p>With any distinct remembrance of a past life there could be no fear of
death as death, no idea even of death! Now, in the next state, to meet
with the Luthers, Miltons, Leibnitzs, Bernouillis, Bonnets, Shaksperes,
etc., and to live a longer and better life, the good and wise entirely
among the good and wise, might serve as a step to break the abruptness
of an immediate Heaven? But it must be a human life; and though the
faith in a hereafter would be more firm, more undoubting, yet, still, it
must not be a sensuous remembrance of a death passed over. No! [it would
be] something like a dream that you had not died, but had been taken
off; in short, the real events with the obscurity of a dream,
accompanied with the notion that you had never died, but that death was
yet to come. As a man who, having walked in his sleep, by rapid openings
of his eyes&mdash;too rapid to be observable by others or rememberable by
himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&mdash;sees and remembers the whole of his path, mixing it with many

<div class="sidenote">OF FIRST LOVES</div>

<p>'Tis one source of mistakes concerning the merits of poems, that to
those read in youth men attribute all that praise which is due to poetry
in general, merely considered as select language in metre. (Little
children should not be taught verses, in my opinion; better not to let
them set eyes on verse till they are ten or eleven years old.) Now,
poetry produces two kinds of pleasure, one for each of the two
master-movements and impulses of man, the gratification of the love of
variety, and the gratification of the love of uniformity&mdash;and that by a
recurrence delightful as a painless and yet exciting act of memory&mdash;tiny
breezelets of surprise, each one destroying the ripplets which the
former had made&mdash;yet all together keeping the surface of the mind in a
bright dimple-smile. So, too, a hatred of vacancy is reconciled with the
love of rest. These and other causes often make [a first acquaintance
with] poetry an overpowering delight to a lad of feeling, as I have
heard Poole relate of himself respecting Edwin and Angelina. But so it
would be with a man bred up in a wilderness by Unseen Beings, who should
yet converse and discourse rationally with him&mdash;how beautiful would not
the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> other man appear whom he saw and knew to be a man by the
resemblance to his own image seen in the clear stream; and would he not,
in like manner, attribute to the man all the divine attributes of
humanity, though, haply, he should be a very ordinary, or even a most
ugly man, compared with a hundred others? Many of us who have felt this
with respect to women have been bred up where few are to be seen; and I
acknowledge that, both in persons and in poems, it is well <i>on the
whole</i> that we should retain our first love, though, alike in both
cases, evils have happened as the consequence.</p>

<p>In the <i>Thren&aelig;</i> or funeral songs and elegies of our old poets, I am
often impressed with the idea of their resemblance to hired weepers in
Rome and among the Irish, where he who howled the loudest and most
wildly was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> most capital mourner and was at the head of his trade.
So [too] see William Browne's elegy on Prince Henry (<i>Britt. Past.
Songs</i> v.), whom, perhaps, he never spoke to. Yet he is a dear fellow,
and I love him, that W. Browne who died at Ottery, and with whose family
my own is united, or, rather, connected and acquainted.</p>

<p>[Colonel James Coleridge, the poet's eldest surviving brother and Henry
Langford Browne of Combe-Satchfield married sisters, Frances and Dorothy
Taylor, whose mother was one of five co-heiresses of Richard Duke of
Otterton.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether a William Browne of Ottery St. Mary, who died in
1645, was the author of <i>The Shepherd's Pipe</i> and <i>Britannia's
Pastorals</i>. Two beautiful inscriptions on a tomb in St. Stephen's Chapel
in the collegiate church of St. Mary Ottery, were, in Southey's opinion

Browne.]</p>

Sharp, therefore, is the pain when I find faults in these friends

I wish to love even more than to be beloved, and am so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> haunted by the

so far dog-like that I love beings superior to myself better than my

seems vanity in me is in great part attributable to this feeling. But of

<p>The desire of carrying things to a greater height of pleasure and

pentameters, his "<i>numine abusum homines</i>" [Carmen, lxxvi. 4] [and
similar harsh expressions]. It is not whether or no the very same ideas
expressed with the very same force and the very same naturalness and
simplicity in the versification of Ovid and Tibullus, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> not be
still more delightful (though even that, for any number of poems, may
well admit a doubt), but whether it is <i>possible</i> so to express them and
whether, in every attempt, the result has not been to substitute manner
for matter, and point that will not bear reflection (so fine that it
breaks the moment you try it) for genuine sense and true feeling, and,
lastly, to confine both the subjects, thoughts, and even words of poetry
within a most beggarly cordon. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The same criticism applies to
Metastasio, and, in Pope, to his quaintness, perversion, unnatural

produce a work almost equal to his own; and, in order to do this,
"<i>down, proud Heart, down</i>" (as we teach little children to say to
themselves, bless them!), all hatred down! and, instead thereof,
charity, calmness, a heart fixed on the good part, though the
understanding is surveying all. Richardson felt truly the defect of
Fielding, or what was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> his excellence, and made that his <i>defect</i>&mdash;a

<p>Oh the profanation of the sacred word <i>the People</i>! Every brutal
Burdett-led mob, assembled on some drunken St. Monday of faction, is the
People forsooth, and each leprous ragamuffin, like a circle in geometry,
is, at once, one and all, and calls its own brutal self, "<i>us</i> the
People." And who are the friends of the People? Not those who would wish
to elevate each of them, or, at least, the child who is to take his
place in the flux of life and death, into something worthy of esteem and
capable of freedom, but those who flatter and infuriate them, as they
<i>are</i>. A contradiction in the very thought! For if, really, they are
good and wise, virtuous and well-informed, how weak must be the motives
of discontent to a truly moral being&mdash;but if the contrary, and the
motives for discontent proportionably strong, how without guilt and
absurdity appeal to them as judges and arbiters? He alone is entitled to
a share in the government of all, who has learnt to govern himself.
There is but one possible ground of a right of freedom&mdash;viz., to
understand and revere its duties.</p>

I know that to a man of sensibility and more emphatically if he be a
literary man, there is <i>no</i> medium between that and "the secret pang
that eats away the heart." ... Hence, even in dreams of sleep, the soul
never <i>is</i>, because it either cannot or dare not be any <i>one</i> thing, but
lives in <i>approaches</i> touched by the outgoing pre-existent ghosts of
many feelings. It feels for ever as a blind man with his protruded staff
dimly through the medium of the instrument by which it pushes off, and
in the act of repulsion&mdash;(O for the eloquence of Shakspere, who alone
could feel and yet know how to embody those conceptions with as curious
a felicity as the thoughts are subtle!)&mdash;as if the finger which I saw
with eyes, had, as it were, another finger, invisible, touching me with
a ghostly touch, even while I feared the real touch from it. What if, in
certain cases, touch acted by itself, co-present with vision, yet not
coalescing? Then I should see the finger as at a distance, and yet feel
a finger touching which was nothing but it, and yet was not it. The two
senses cannot co-exist without a sense of causation. The <i>touch</i> must be
the effect of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> finger [which] I see, and yet it is not yet near to

<div class="sidenote">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CLERICAL ERRORS</div>

<p>It is worth noting and endeavouring to detect the Law of the Mind, by
which, in writing earnestly while we are thinking, we omit words
necessary to the sense. It will be found, I guess, that we seldom omit
the material word, but generally the word by which the mind expresses
its modification of the <i>verbum materiale</i>. Thus, in the preceding page,
7th line, <i>medium</i> is the <i>materiale</i>: that was its own brute, inert
sense&mdash;but the <i>no</i> is the mind's action, its <i>use</i> of the word.</p>

<p>I think this a hint of some value. Thus, <i>the</i> is a word in constant
combination with the passive or material words; but <i>to</i> is an act of
the mind, and I had written <i>the</i> detect instead of <i>to</i> detect. Again,
when my sense demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> "the" to express a distinct modification of some
<i>verbum materiale</i>, I remember to have often omitted it in writing. The
principle is evident&mdash;the mind borrows the <i>materia</i> from without, and
is passive with regard to it as the mere subject "stoff"&mdash;a simple event
of memory takes place; but having the other in itself, the inward Having
with its sense of security passes for the outward Having&mdash;or is all
memory an anxious act, and thereby suspended by vivid security? or are
both reasons the same? or if not, are they consistent, and capable of
being co-or sub-ordinated? It will be lucky if some day, after having
written on for two or three sheets rapidly and as a first copy, without
correcting, I should by chance glance on this note, not having thought
at all about it during or before the time of writing; and then to
examine every word omitted.</p>

<p>O! many, many are the seeings, hearings, of pure love that have a being

debased below even their own lowest nature by associations accidental,
and of vicious accidents, is <i>blasphemy</i>. What seest thou yonder? The
lovely countenance of a lovely maiden, fervid yet awe-suffering with
devotion&mdash;her face resigned to bliss or bale; or a <i>bit</i> of <i>flesh</i>; or,
rather, that which cannot be seen unless by him whose very seeing is
more than an act of mere sight&mdash;that which refuses all words, because
words being, perforce, generalities do not awake, but really involve
associations of other words as well as other thoughts&mdash;but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> which I
see, must be felt, be possessed, in and by its sole self! What! shall
the <i>statuary</i> Pygmalion of necessity feel this for every part of the
insensate marble, and shall the lover Pygmalion in contemplating the
living statue, the heart-adored maiden, breathing forth in every look,
every movement, the genial life imbreathed of God, grovel in the mire
and grunt the language of the swinish slaves of the Circe, of vulgar
generality and still more vulgar association? The Polyclete that created

<div class="sidenote">THE MANUFACTURE OF PROPHESY</div>

<p>One of the causes of superstition, and also of enthusiasm, and, indeed,
of all errors in matters of fact, is the great power with which the
effect acts upon and modifies the remembrance of its cause, at times
even transforming it in the mind. Let <i>A</i> have said a few words to <i>B</i>,
which (by some change and accommodation of them to the event in the mind
of <i>B</i>) have been remarkably fulfilled; and let <i>B</i> remind <i>A</i> of these
words which he (<i>A</i>) had spoken, <i>A</i> will instantly forget all his mood,
motive, and meaning, at the time of speaking them, nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> remember words

an imagined fulfillment, a prophetic grandeur&mdash;himself, in his own
faith, a seer of no small inspiration. We yet want the growth of a
prophet and self-deceived wonder-worker <i>step by step</i>, through all the
stages; and, yet, what ample materials exist for a true and nobly-minded
psychologist! For, in order to make fit use of these materials, he must
love and honour as well as understand human nature&mdash;rather, he must love

alas! grows weaker daily&mdash;or a fault from my indolence in not noting it
down, as I do this)&mdash;that there is a period in a man's life, varying in
various men, from thirty-five to forty-five, and operating most strongly
in bachelors, widowers, or those worst and miserablest widowers, unhappy
husbands, in which a man finds himself at the <i>top of the hill</i>, and
having attained, perhaps, what he wishes, begins to ask himself, What is
all this for?&mdash;begins to feel the vanity of his pursuits, becomes
half-melancholy, gives in to wild dissipation or self-regardless
drinking; and some, not content with these (not <i>slow</i>) poisons, destroy
themselves, and leave their ingenious female or female-minded friends to
fish out some <i>motive</i> for an act which proceeded from a <i>motive-making</i>
impulse, which would have acted even without a motive (even as the
terror<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> in nightmare is a bodily sensation, and though it most often

one, if not this hour, yet the next. I had <i>felt</i> this truth, but never
saw it before clearly: it came upon me at Malta under the melancholy,
dreadful feeling of finding myself to be <i>man</i>, by a distinct division
from boyhood, youth, and "young man." Dreadful was the feeling&mdash;till
then life had flown so that I had always been a boy, as it were; and
this sensation had blended in all my conduct, my willing acknowledgment
of superiority, and, in truth, my meeting every person as a superior at

<p>Those who think lowliest of themselves, perhaps with a <i>feeling</i>
stronger than rational comparison would justify, are apt to feel and
express undue asperity for the faults and defects of those whom they
habitually have looked up to as to their superiors. For placing
themselves very low, perhaps too low, wherever a series of experiences,
struggled against for a while, have at length convinced the mind that in
such and such a moral habit the long-idolised superior is far below even
itself, the grief and anger will be in proportion. "If even <i>I</i> could
never have done this, O anguish, that <i>he</i>, so much my superior, should
do it! If even <i>I</i> with all my infirmities have not this defect, this
selfishness, that <i>he</i> should have it!" This is the course of thought.
Men are bad enough; and yet they often think themselves worse than they

thoughts. The poisoned chalice is brought back to our own lips.</p>

<p>From what reasons do I believe in <i>continuous</i> and ever-continuable
consciousness? From conscience! Not for myself, but for my conscience,
that is, my affections and duties towards others, I should have no
self&mdash;for self is definition, but all boundary implies neighbourhood and
is knowable only by neighbourhood or relations. Does the understanding
say nothing in favour of immortality? It says nothing for or against;
but its silence gives consent, and is better than a thousand arguments
such as mere understanding could afford. But miracles! "Do you speak of
them as proofs or as natural consequences of revelation, whose presence
is proof only by precluding the disproof that would arise from their
absence?" "Nay, I speak of them as of positive funda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>mental proofs."
Then I dare answer you "Miracles in that sense are blasphemies in
morality, contradictions in reason. God the Truth, the actuality of
logic, the very <i>logos</i>&mdash;He deceive his creatures and demonstrate the
properties of a triangle by the confusion of all properties! If a
miracle merely means an event before inexperienced, it proves only
itself, and the inexperience of mankind. Whatever other definition be
given of it, or rather attempted (for no other not involving direct
contradiction can be given), it is blasphemy. It calls darkness light,
and makes Ignorance the mother of Malignity, the appointed nurse of
religion&mdash;which is knowledge as opposed to mere calculating and
conjectural understanding. Seven years ago, but oh! in what happier
times&mdash;I wrote thus&mdash;</p>

<p>And now, that I am alone and utterly hopeless for myself, yet still I
love&mdash;and more strongly than ever feel that conscience or the duty of
love is the proof of continuing, as it is the cause and condition of
existing consciousness. How beautiful the harmony! Whence could the
proof come, so appropriately, so conformly with all nature, in which the

<div class="sidenote">CHYMICAL ANALOGIES</div>

<p>I am persuaded that the chymical technology, as far as it was borrowed
from life and intelligence, half-metaphorically, half-mystically, may be
brought back again (as when a man borrows of another a sum which the
latter had previously borrowed of him, because he is too polite to
remind him of a debt) to the use of psychology in many instances, and,
above all, [may be re-adapted to] the philosophy of language, which
ought to be experimentative and analytic of the elements of
meaning&mdash;their double, triple, and quadruple combinations, of simple
aggregation or of composition by balance of opposition.</p>

<p>Thus innocence is distinguished from virtue, and <i>vice versâ</i>. In both
of them there is a positive, but in each opposite. A decomposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>tion must
take place in the first instance, and then a new composition, in order
for innocence to become virtue. It loses a positive, and then the base
attracts another different positive, by the higher affinity of the same
base under a different temperature for the latter.</p>

<p>I stated the legal use of the innocent as opposed to mere <i>not guilty</i>
(he was not only acquitted, but was proved innocent), only to shew the
existence of a <i>positive</i> in the former&mdash;by no means as confounding this
use of the word with the moral pleasurable feeling connected with it
when used of little children, maidens, and those who in mature age
preserve this sweet fragrance of vernal life, this mother's gift and
so-seldom-kept keepsake to her child, as she sends him forth into the
world. The distinction is obvious. Law agnizes actions alone, and
character only as presumptive or illustrative of particular action as to
its guilt or non-guilt, or to the commission or non-commission. But our
moral feelings are never pleasurably excited except as they refer to a
state of being&mdash;and the most glorious actions do not delight us as
separate acts, or, rather, facts, but as representatives of the being of
the agent&mdash;mental stenographs which bring an indeterminate extension
within the field of easy and simultaneous vision, diffused being
rendered visible by condensation. Only for the hero's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> sake do we exult
in the heroic act, or, rather, the act abstracted from the hero would no
longer appear to us heroic. Not, therefore, solely from the advantage of
poets and historians do the deeds of ancient Greece and Rome strike us
into admiration, while we relate the very same deeds of barbarians as
matters of curiosity, but because in the former we refer the deed to the
individual exaltation of the agent, in the latter only to the physical
result of a given state of society. Compare the [heroism of that] Swiss
patriot, with his bundle of spears turned towards his breast, in order
to break the Austrian pikemen, and that of the Mameluke, related to me
by Sir Alexander Ball, who, when his horse refused to plunge in on the
French line, turned round and <i>backed</i> it on them, with a certainty of
death, in order to effect the same purpose. In the former, the state of
mind arose from reason, morals, liberty, the sense of the duty owing to
the independence of his country, and its continuing in a state
compatible with the highest perfection and development; while the latter
was predicative only of mere animal habit, ferocity, and unreasoned
antipathy to strangers of a different dress and religion.</p>

Travels, vol. i. pp. 105-6:&mdash;"I heard of a monstrous green turtle once
taken at the Port Royal, in the Bay of Campeachy, that was four feet
deep from the back to the belly, and the belly six feet broad. Captain
Rock's son, of about nine or ten years of age, went in it as in a boat,
on board his father's ship, about a quarter of a mile from the shore."
And a few lines before&mdash;"The green turtle are so called because their
shell is greener than any other. It is very thin and clear, and better
clouded than the Hawksbill, but 'tis used only for <i>inlays</i>, being

on the shore of Loch Leven for a while, about to have transported it
inland for a curiosity, and the blind boy have found it? Would not the
incident be in equal keeping with that of the child, as well as the
image and tone of romantic uncommonness?</p>

<p>If I have leisure, I may, perhaps, write a wild rhyme on the <i>Bell</i>,

<p>The army of Clotharius besieging Sens were frightened away by the bells
of St. Stephen's, rung by the contrivance of Lupus, Bishop of Orleans.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>For ringing the largest bell, as a Passing-bell, a high price was wont
to be paid, because being heard afar it both kept the evil spirits at a
greater distance, and gave the chance of the greater number of prayers
<i>pro mortuo</i>, from the pious who heard it.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<p>Names of saints were given to bells that it might appear the voice of
the Saint himself calling to prayer. Man will humanise all things.</p>

<p>[It is strange that Coleridge should make no mention of Schiller's "Song
of the Bell," of which he must, at any rate, have heard the title.
Possibly the idea remained though its source was forgotten. The Latin
distichs were introduced by Longfellow in his "Golden Legend."</p>

<p>Of the cow-bells in the Hartz he gives the following account in an
unpublished letter to his wife. April-May, 1799. "But low down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
valley and in little companies on each bank of the river a multitude of
green conical fir-trees, with herds of cattle wandering about almost
every one with a cylindrical bell around its neck, of no inconsiderable
size. And as they moved, scattered over the narrow vale, and up among
the trees of the hill, the noise was like that of a great city in the
stillness of the Sabbath morning, where all the steeples, all at once
are ringing for Church. The whole was a melancholy scene and quite new
to me."]</p>

<p>Thought and attention are very different things. I never expected the

from the readers of <i>The Friend</i>. I did expect the latter, and was
disappointed. Jan. 3, 1810.</p>

<p>This is a most important distinction, and in the new light afforded by
it to my mind, I see more plainly why mathematics cannot be a
substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> for logic, much less for metaphysics, that is,
transcendental logic, and why, therefore, Cambridge has produced so few
men of genius and original power since the time of Newton. Not only it
does not call forth the balancing and discriminating power [<i>that</i> I saw
long ago] but it requires only <i>attention,</i> not <i>thought</i> or
self-production.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAW AND GOSPEL</div>

<p>"The man who squares his conscience by the law" was, formerly, a phrase
for a prudent villain, an unprincipled coward. At present the law takes
in everything&mdash;the things most incongruous with its nature, as the moral
motive, and even the feelings of sensibility resulting from accidents of
cultivation, novel-reading for instance. If, therefore, <i>at all</i> times,
the law would be found to have a much greater influence on the actions
of men than men generally suppose, or the agents were themselves
conscious of, this influence we must expect to find augmented at the
present time in proportion to the encroachments of the law on religion,
the moral sense, and the sympathies engendered by artificial rank.
Examine this and begin, for instance, with reviews, and so on through
the common legal immoralities of life, in the pursuits and pleasures of
the higher half of the middle classes of society in Great Britain.</p>

<p>It were not an unpleasing fancy, nor one wholly unworthy of a serious
and charitable Christianity, to derive a shadow of hope for the
conversion and purification of the Roman Apostasy from the conduct and
character of St. Peter as shadowing out the history of the Latin Church,
whose ruling pastor calls himself the successor of that saint. Thus, by
proud <i>humility</i>, he hazarded the loss of his heavenly portion in
objecting to Christ's taking upon himself a lowly office and character
of a servant (hence the pomps and vanities with which Rome has tricked
out her bishops, &amp;c.), the eager drawing of the fleshly sword in defence
of Christ; the denying of Christ at the cross (in the apostasy); but,
finally, his bitter repentance at the third crowing of the cock (perhaps
Wickliffe and Huss the first, Luther the second, and the third yet to
come-or, perhaps Wickliffe and Luther the first, the second may be the
present state of humiliation, and the third yet to come). After this her
eyes will be opened to the heavenly vision of the universal acceptance
of Christ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> all good men of all sects, that is, that faith is a moral,

<div class="sidenote">THE IDEAL MARRIAGE</div>

<p>On some delightful day in early spring some of my countrymen hallow the
anniversary of their marriage, and with love and fear go over the
reckoning of the past and the unknown future. The wife tells with
half-renewed modesty all the sweet feelings that she disguised and
cherished in the courting-time; the man looks with a tear full in his
eye and blesses the hour when for the first time (and oh! let it be the
last) he spake deep and solemn to a beloved being&mdash;"Thou art mine and I
am thine, and henceforward I shield and shelter [thee] against the
world, and thy sorrows shall be my sorrows, and though abandoned by all
men, we two will abide together in love and duty."</p>

<p>In the holy eloquent solitude where the very stars that twinkle seem to
be a <i>voice</i> that suits the dream, a voice of a dream, a voice soundless
and yet for the <i>ear</i> not the <i>eye</i> of the soul, when the winged soul
passes over vale and mountain, sinks into glens, and then climbs with
the cloud, and passes from cloud to cloud, and thence from sun to
sun&mdash;never is she alone. Always one, the dearest, accompanies and even
when he melts, diffused in the blue sky, she melts at the same moment
into union with the beloved.</p>

<p>That our religious faiths, by the instincts which lead us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
metaphysical investigation, are founded in a practical necessity, not a
mere intellectual craving after knowledge, and systematic conjecture, is
evinced by the interest which all men take in the questions of future
existence, and the being of God; while even among those who are
speculative by profession a few phantasts only have troubled themselves
with the questions of pre-existence, or with attempts to demonstrate the
<i>posse</i> and <i>esse</i> of a devil. But in the latter case more is involved.
Concerning pre-existence men in general have neither care nor belief;
but a devil is taken for granted, and, if we might trust words, with the
same faith as a Deity&mdash;"He neither believes God or devil." And yet,
while we are delighted in hearing proofs of the one, we never think of
asking a simple question concerning the other. This, too, originates in
a practical source. The Deity is not a mere solution of difficulties
concerning origination, but a truth which spreads light and joy and hope
and certitude through all things&mdash;while a devil <i>is</i> a mere solution of
an enigma, an assumption to silence our uneasiness. That end answered
(and most easily are such ends answered), we have no further concern
with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIRITUAL RELIGION</div>

<p>A thing cannot be one <i>and</i> three at the same time! True! but <i>time</i>
does not apply to God. He is neither one in time nor three in time, for
he exists not in time at all&mdash;the Eternal!</p>

<p>The truly religious man, when he is not conveying his feelings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
beliefs to other men, and does not need the medium of words&mdash;O! how
little does he find in his religious sense either of form or of
number&mdash;it is <i>infinite</i>! Alas! why do we all seek by instinct for a
God, a supersensual, but because we feel the insufficiency, the
unsubstantiality of all <i>forms</i>, and formal being for itself. And shall
we explain <i>a</i> by <i>x</i> and then <i>x</i> by <i>a</i>&mdash;give a soul to the body, and
then a body to the soul&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, a body to the body&mdash;feel the weakness
of the weak, and call in the strengthener, and then make the very
weakness the substratum of the strength? This is worse than the poor
Indian! Even he does not make the tortoise support the elephant, and yet
put the elephant under the tortoise!</p>

<p>But we are too social, we become in a sort idolaters&mdash;for the means we
are obliged to use to excite notions of truth in the minds of others we
by witchcraft of slothful association impose on ourselves for the truths
themselves. Our intellectual bank stops payment, and we pass an act by
acclamation that hereafter the paper promises shall be the gold and
silver itself&mdash;and ridicule a man for a dreamer and reviver of
antiquated dreams who believes that gold and silver exist. This may do
as well in the market, but O! for the universal, for the man himself the

abhor me. For not because I enforced a truth were they pleased in the
first instance, but because I had supported a favourite notion of theirs
which they loved for its and their sake, and therefore would be glad to
find it true&mdash;not that loving Truth they loved this opinion as one of
its forms and consequences. The root! the root must be attacked!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TIME TO CRY OUT</div>

<p>Among the evils that attend a conscientious author who writes in a

plausible charges of envy, mortified vanity, and, above all, of
self-conceit before those whose bad passions would make even the most
improbable charges plausible.</p>

<p>What <i>can</i> he do? Tell the truth, and the whole truth plainly, and with
the natural affection which it inspires, and keeping off (difficult
task!) all <i>scorn</i> (for to suppress resentment is easy), let him trust
the bread to the waters in the firm faith that wisdom shall be justified
by her children. Vanity! self-conceit! What vanity, what self-conceit?
What say I more than this? Ye who think and feel the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> will love and

comparative effect I have made on your intellectual powers, in enabling
you better to defend before others, or more clearly to <i>onlook</i>
(<i>anschauen</i>) in yourselves the truths to which your noblest being bears
witness. The rest I leave to the judgment of posterity, utterly
unconcerned whether <i>my name</i> be attached to these opinions or (<i>my</i>

<p>But what can I say, when I have declared my abhorrence of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>? In vain should I tell my critics that were I placed on the rack
I could not remember ten lines of my own poems, and that on seeing my

Southey, and that I am well aware that from utter disregard and oblivion
of anything and all things which they can know of me by experience, my

the heart of each ripens in the other's looks within the unburst calyx,
and fear becomes so sweet that it seems but a fear of losing hope in
certainty; the second, when the sun is setting in the calm eve of
confident love, and [the lovers] in mute recollection enjoy each other.
"I fear to speak, I fear to hear you speak, so deeply do I now enjoy
your presence, so totally possess you in myself, myself in you. The very
sound would break the union and separate <i>you-me</i> into you and me. We
both, and this sweet room, its books, its furniture, and the shadows on

the things symbolised will perforce be presented to us more easily, as
well as with additional beauty, by a correspondent harmony of the
symbols with each other. Thus, <i>heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodie

Especially with regard to obedience, how is it possible that they should

habit gradually turned lie into belief, partial and <i>stagnate</i> truth

the laymen were open to various impulses and influences, which their

Metastasio, <i>from causes I need not here put down, there will be a
poetical language</i>; but that a poet ever uses a word as poetical&mdash;that
is, formally&mdash;which he, in the same mood and thought, would not use in
prose or conversation, Milton's Prose Works will assist us in
disproving. But as soon as literature becomes common, and critics
numerous in any country, and a large body of men seek to express
themselves habitually in the most precise, sensuous, and impassioned
words, the difference as to mere words ceases, as, for example, the
German prose writers. Produce to me <i>one</i> word out of Klopstock,
Wieland, Schiller, Goethe, Voss, &amp;c., which I will not find as
frequently used in the most energetic prose writers. The sole difference
in style is that poetry demands a severe keeping&mdash;it admits nothing that
prose may not often admit, but it oftener rejects. In other words, it
presupposes a more continuous state of passion. <i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Provincialisms
of poets who have become the supreme classics in countries one in
language but under various states and governments have aided this false
idea, as, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> Italy, the Tuscanisms of Dante, Ariosto, and Alfieri,
foolishly imitated by Venetians, Romans, and Neapolitans. How much this
is against the opinion of Dante, see his admirable treatise on "Lingua
Volgare Nobile," the first, I believe, of his prose or <i>prose and verse</i>
works; for the "Convito" and "La Vita Nuova" are, one-third, in metre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVE</div>

<p>To find our happiness incomplete without the happiness of some other

applies equally to friendship, to the parental and to the conjugal
relations. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> what is love? Love as it may subsist between two persons
of different senses? This&mdash;and what more than this? The mutual
dependence of their happiness, each on that of the other, each being at
once cause and effect. You, therefore, I&mdash;I, therefore you. The sense of
this reciprocity of well-being, is that which first stamps and
legitimates the name of happiness in all the other advantages and
favourable accidents of nature, or fortune, without which they would
change their essence and become like the curse of Tantalus, insulting
remembrances of misery, of that most unquiet of all miseries, means of
happiness blasted and transformed by incompleteness, nay, by the loss of
the sole organ through which we could enjoy them.</p>

<p>Suppose a wide and delightful landscape, and what the eye is to the
light, and the light to the eye, that interchangeably is the lover to
the beloved. "O best beloved! who lovest <i>me</i> the best!" In strictest
propriety of application might he thus address her, if only she with
equal truth could echo the same sense in the same feeling. "Light of
mine eye! by which alone I not only see all I see, but which makes up
more than half the loveliness of the objects seen, yet, still, like the

<p>This for the motto&mdash;to examine and attest the fact, and then to explain
the reason. First, then, there are the extraordinary qualifications
demanded for true friendship, arising from the multitude of causes that
make men delude themselves and attribute to friendship what is only a
similarity of pursuit, or even a mere dislike of feeling oneself alone
in anything. But, secondly, supposing the friendship to be as real as
human nature ordinarily permits, yet how many causes are at constant war
against it, whether in the shape of violent irruptions or unobserved yet
constant wearings away by dyspathy, &amp;c. Exemplify this in youth and then
in manhood. First, there is the influence of wives, how frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>deadly to friendship, either by direct encroach, or, perhaps,
intentional plans of alienation! Secondly, there is the effect of
families, by otherwise occupying the heart; and, thirdly, the action of
life in general, by the worldly-wise, chilling effects of prudential
anxieties.</p>

<p>Corollary. These reflections, however, suggest an argument in favour of
the existing indissolubility of marriage.</p>

<p>To be compelled to make it up, or consent to be miserable and

for such is the state of moral feeling even with the English public,
that an instance of credulity to an ingenious scheme which has failed in

crucified, and the why and the wherefore&mdash;and that the soberest,
law-obeying, most prudent nation in the world would need Him as much as
a nation of drunkards, thieves and profligates. How was this? Why, I
take it, those old parsons thought, very wisely, that the pulpit was the
place for truths that applied to all men, humbled all alike (not
mortified one or two, and sent the rest home, scandal-talking with
pharisaic "I thank thee, God, I am not as so and so, but I was glad to

they were all <i>men</i>&mdash;that private vices depend so much on particular

not suited to the pulpit) that it would be a cold generality affair&mdash;and
that, therefore, they considered the pulpit as <i>one</i> part of their duty,
but to their whole congregation as <i>men</i>, and that the other part of
their duty, which they thought equally binding on them, was to each and
every member of that congregation as John Harris, or James Tomkins, in
private conversation&mdash;and, like that of Mr. Longford, sometimes to
rebuke and warn, sometimes to comfort, sometimes and oftener to
instruct, and render them capable of under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>standing his sermon. In short
they would <i>preach</i> as Luther, and would converse as Mr. Longford to

<div class="sidenote">TIME REAL AND IMAGINARY</div>

<p>How marked the contrast between troubled manhood, and joyously-active
youth in the sense of time! To the former, time like the sun in an empty
sky is never seen to move, but only to have <i>moved</i>. There, there it
was, and now 'tis here, now distant! yet all a blank between. To the
latter it is as the full moon in a fine breezy October night, driving on
amid clouds of all shapes and hues, and kindling shifting colours, like
an ostrich in its speed, and yet seems not to have moved at all. This I
feel to be a just image of time real and time as felt, in two different
states of being. The title of the poem therefore (for poem it ought to
be) should be time real and time felt (in the sense of time) in active
youth, or activity with hope and fullness of aim in any period, and in
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>spondent, objectless manhood&mdash;time objective and subjective.</p>

<p>[The riddle is hard to read, but the underlying thought seems to be that
in youth the sense of time is like the apparent motion of the moon
through clouds, ever driving on, but ever seeming to stand still;
whereas the sense of time in manhood is like the sun, which seems to be
stationary, and yet, at short intervals, is seen to have moved. This is
time <i>felt</i> in two different states of being. Time real is, as it were,
sun or moon which move independently of our perceptions of their
movements. The note (1811), no doubt, contains the germ of "Time Real
and Imaginary" first published in "Sibylline Leaves" in 1817, which
Coleridge in his Preface describes as a "school-boy poem," and
interprets thus: "By imaginary time I meant the state of a schoolboy's
mind when, on his return to school, he projects his being in his
day-dreams, and lives in his next holidays, six months hence!" The
explanation was probably an afterthought. "The two lovely children" who
"run an endless race" may have haunted his schoolboy dreams, may perhaps
have returned to the dreams of his troubled manhood, bringing with them
the sense rather than the memory of youth, intermingled with a
consciousness that youth was gone for ever, but the composition of the
poem dates from 1811, or possibly 1815, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> the preparation of the
poems for the press would persuade him once more to express his thoughts

<div class="sidenote">THE HAG NIGHTMARE</div>

<p>Elucidation of my <i>all-zermalming</i>, [that is, all-crushing] argument on
the subject of ghosts, apparitions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Night-mare is, I think, always, even when it occurs in the midst of
sleep, and not as it more commonly does after a waking interval, a state
not of sleep, but of stupor of the outward organs of sense&mdash;not in
words, indeed, but yet in fact distinguishable from the suspended power
of the senses in true sleep, while the volitions of reason, that is the
faculty of comparison, &amp;c., are awake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> though disturbed. This stupor
seems to be occasioned by some painful sensations of unknown locality
(most often, I believe, in the lower bowel) which, withdrawing the
attention to itself from the sense of other realities present, makes us
asleep to them, indeed, but otherwise awake. And, whenever the
derangement occasions an interruption in the circulation, aided,
perhaps, by pressure, awkward position, &amp;c., the part deadened, as the
hand, the arm, or the foot and leg, or the side, transmits double touch
as single touch, to which the imagination, therefore, the true inward
creatrix, instantly out of the chaos of elements or shattered fragments
of memory, puts together some form to fit it. And this [<i>imaginatio</i>]
derives an over-mastering sense of reality from the circumstance that
the power of reason, being in good measure awake, most generally
presents to us all the accompanying images very nearly as they existed
the moment before, when we fell out of anxious wakefulness into this
reverie. For example, the bed, the curtain, the room and its furniture,
the knowledge of who lives in the next room, and so forth contribute to
the illusion.... In short, the night-mare is not, properly, a dream, but
a species of reverie, akin to somnambulism, during which the
understanding and moral sense are awake, though more or less confused,
and over the terrors of which the reason can exert no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> influence,
because it is not true <i>terror</i>, that is, apprehension of danger, but is
itself a specific sensation&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>terror corporeus sive materialis</i>. The
explanation and classification of these strange sensations, the organic
material analogous (<i>ideas materiales intermedias</i>, as the Cartesians
say) of Fear, Hope, Rage, Shame, and (strangest of all) Remorse, form at
present the most difficult, and at the same time the most interesting
problem of psychology, and are intimately connected with prudential
morals, the science, that is, of morals not as the ground and law of
duty, but in their relation to the empirical hindrances and focillations
in the realising of the law by human beings. The solution of this
problem would, perhaps, throw great doubt on the present [notion] that
the forms and feelings of sleep are always the reflections and confused
echoes of our waking thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>Where health is&mdash;at least, though pain be no stranger, yet when the
breath can rise, and turn round like a comet at its perihelion in its
ellipse, and again descend, instead of being a Sisiphus's stone; and the
chest can expand as by its own volition and the head sits firm yet
mobile aloft, like the vane of a tower on a hill shining in the blue
air, and appropriating sunshine and moonlight whatever weight of clouds
brood below&mdash;O when health and hope, and if not competence yet a
debtless <i>unwealth, libera et l&aelig;ta paupertas</i>, is his, a man may have
and love many friends, but yet, if indeed they be friends, he lives with
each a several and individual life.</p>

man's life exhibits two sorts of selfishness, those which are and those
which are not objects of his own consciousness. <i>A</i> is thinking,
perhaps, of some plan in which he may benefit another, and during this
absorption consults his own little bodily comforts blindly&mdash;occupies the
best place at the fire-side, or asks at once, "Where am I to sit?"
instead of first inquiring after the health of another. Now the error
lies here, that <i>B</i>, in complaining of <i>A</i>, first takes for granted
either that these are acts of conscious selfishness in <i>A</i>, or, if he
allows the truth, yet considers them just as bad (and so perhaps they
may be in a certain sense), but <i>forgets</i> that his own life presents the
same, judges of his own life exclusively by his own consciousness, that
of another by conscious and unconscious in a lump. A monkey's

<p>Try not to become disgusted with active benevolence, or despondent

genuine enthusiasts who gain a reputation for the thing&mdash;then slip in

connections derived thereby&mdash;quite gratuitous, however, and
bustling-active&mdash;but yet <i>bribe high</i> to become the unpaid physicians of
the dispensary at St. Luke's Hospital, and bow and scrape and intrigue,
Carlyleise and Knappise for it. And such is the [case with regard to]
the slave trade. The first abolitionists were the good men who laboured
when the thing seemed desperate&mdash;it was virtue for its own sake. Then
the quakers, Granville Sharp, etc.&mdash;then the restless spirits who are
under the action of tyrannical oppression from images, and, gradually,
mixed vanity and love of power with it&mdash;the
politicians + saints = Wilberforce. Last come the Scotchmen&mdash;and Brougham is
now canvassing more successfully for the seat of Wilberforce, who
retires with great honour and regret, from infirmities of age and
<i>enoughness</i>. It is just as with the great original benefactors and
founders of useful plans, Raleigh, Sir Hugh Middleton, etc.&mdash;men of
genius succeeded by sharpers, but who often can better carry on what
they never could have first conceived&mdash;and this, too, by their very want
of those qualities and virtues which were necessary to the discovery.</p>

be assigned <i>why</i> it should disappear. Shall we not always, in this life
at least, remain <i>anim&aelig; dimidiat&aelig;?</i>&mdash;must not the moral reason always
hold out the perfecting of each by union of both as good and lovely?
With reason, therefore, and conscience let love vanish, but let these

<p>O what wisdom could I <i>talk</i> to a <span class="smcap">YOUTH</span> of genius and

with a person of undoubted talents, more especially if a woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> and of
apparent goodness, and yet you feel uncomfortable, and urged against
your nature, and, therefore, probably in vain, to be on your guard&mdash;then
take yourself to task and enquire what strong reason, moral or
prudential, you have to form any intimacy or even familiarity with that
person. If you after this (or moreover) detect any falsehood, or, what
amounts to the same, proneness and quickness to look into, to analyse,
to find out and represent evil or weakness in others (however this may
be disguised even from the person's own mind by <i>candour</i>, [in] pointing
out the good at the same time, by affectation of speculative truth, as
psychologists, or of telling you all their thoughts as open-hearted
friends), then let no reason but a strong and coercive one suffice to
make you any other than as formal and distant acquaintance as
circumstances will permit." And am I not now suffering, in part, for
forcing my feelings into slavery to my notions, and intellectual
admiration for a whole year and more with regard to &mdash;&mdash;? [So the MS.] If
I played the hypocrite to myself, can I blame my fate that he has, at
length, played the deceiver to me? Yet, God knows! I did it most

apprehension of being feared and shrunk from as a something
transnatural) I will here record&mdash;and my motive, or, rather, impulse, to
do this seems an effort to eloign and abalienate it from the dark adyt
of my own being by a visual outness, and not the wish for others to see
it. It consists in a sudden second sight of some hidden vice, past,
present or to come, of the person or per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>sons with whom I am about to
form a close intimacy&mdash;which never deters me, but rather (as all these
transnaturals) urges me on, just like the feeling of an eddy-torrent to
a swimmer. I see it as a vision, feel it as a prophecy, not as one
<i>given</i> me by any other being, but as an act of my own spirit, of the
absolute <i>noumenon</i>, which, in so doing, seems to have offended against
some law of its being, and to have acted the traitor by a commune with

which all men in possession of the ordinary human understanding may
comprehend as much and as well as the profoundest philosopher and the
most learned theologian. Such are the truths relating to the <i>logos</i> and
its oneness with the self-existent Deity, and of the humanity of Christ
and its union with the <i>logos</i>. It is idle, therefore, to refrain from
preaching on these subjects, provided only such preparations have been
made as no man can be a Christian without. The misfortune is that the
majority are Christians only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> in name, and by birth only. Let them but
once, according to St. James, have looked down steadfastly into the

anywhere the "one low piping note more sweet than all"&mdash;there is not the
divine vision of the poet, which gives the full fruition of sight
without the effort&mdash;and where the feelings of the heart are struck, they
are awakened only to complain of and recoil from the occasion. O! it is
mournful to see and wonder at such a marvel of labour, erudition and
talent concentered into such a burning-glass of factitious power, and
yet to know that it is all in vain&mdash;like the Pyramids, it shows what can

<p>"That not one of the <i>peculiarities</i> of Christianity, no one point in
which, being clearly different from other religions or philosophies, it
would have, at least, the <i>possibility</i> of being superior to all, is
retained by the modern Unitarians." This remark is occasioned by my
reflections on the fact that Christianity <i>exclusively</i> has asserted the
<i>positive</i> being of evil or sin, "of sin the exceeding sinfulness"&mdash;and
thence exclusively the <i>freedom</i> of the creature, as that, the clear
intuition of which is, both, the result and the accompaniment of
redemption. The nearest philosophy to Christianity is the Platonic, and
it is observable that this is the mere anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>podes of the
Hartleio-Lockian held by the Unitarians; but the true honours of
Christianity would be most easily manifested by a comparison even with
that "<i>nec pari nec secundo</i>," but yet "<i>omnibus aliis propriore</i>," the
Platonic! With what contempt, even in later years, have I not
contemplated the doctrine of a devil! but now I see the intimate
connection, if not as existent <i>person</i>, yet as essence and symbol with
Christianity&mdash;and that so far from being identical with Manicheism, it
is the surest antidote (that is, rightly understood).</p>

<i>substantiality</i> of head and heart, added to it the elegancies and manly
politure of Fracastorius, Flaminius, Vida and their corrivals, this
letter would have been a classical gem. To a translator of genius, and
who possessed the English language as unembarrassed property, the
defects of style in the original would present no obstacle; nay, rather
an honourable motive in the well-grounded hope of rendering the version
a finer poem than the original.</p>

general nature, cannot convey. Now this I am disposed to deny, that is,
in any comparative sense. In my opinion there is nothing which, being
equally known as any other thing, may not be conveyed by words with
equal clearness. But the question of the source of the remark is, to
whom? If I say that in jaundice the skin looks yellow, my words have no
meaning for a man who has no sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> colours. Words are but
remembrances, though remembrance may be so excited, as by the <i>a priori</i>
powers of the mind to produce a <i>tertium aliquid</i>. The utmost, therefore
that should be said is that every additament of perception requires a
new word, which (like all other words) will be intelligible to all who
have seen the subject recalled by it, and who have learnt that such a
word or phrase was appropriated to it; and this may be attained either
by a new word, as <i>platinum</i>, <i>titanium</i>, <i>osmium</i>, etc., for the new
metals, or an epithet peculiarising the application of an old word. For
instance, no one can have attended to the brightness of the eyes in a
healthy person in high spirits and particularly delighted by some
occurrence, and that of the eye of a person deranged or predisposed to
derangement, without observing the difference; and, in this case, the
phrase "a maniacal glitter of the eye" conveys as clear a notion as that
jaundice is marked by yellow. There is, doubtless, a difference, but no
other than that of the <i>commencement</i> of particular knowledge by the
application of universal knowledge (that is to all who have the senses
and common faculties of men), and the next step of knowledge when it
particularises itself. But the defect is not in words, but in the
imperfect knowledge of those to whom they are addressed. Then proof is
obvious. Desire a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> physician or metaphysician, or a lawyer to mention
the most perspicuous book in their several knowledges. Then bid them
read that book to a sensible carpenter or shoemaker, and a great part
will be as unintelligible as a technical treatise on carpentering to the
lawyer or physician, who had not been brought up in a carpenter's shop
or looked at his tools.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on this for more reasons than one: first, because a remark
that seems at first sight the same, namely, that "everything clearly
perceived may be conveyed in simple common language," without taking in
the "to whom?" is the disease of the age&mdash;an arrogant pusillanimity, a
hatred of all information that cannot be obtained without thinking; and,
secondly, because the pretended imperfection of language is often a
disguise of muddy thoughts; and, thirdly, because to the mind itself it
is made an excuse for indolence in determining what the fact or truth is
which is the premise. For whether there does or does not exist a term in
our present store of words significant thereof&mdash;if not, a word must be
made&mdash;and, indeed, all wise men have so acted from Moses to Aristotle
and from Theophrastus to Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>The sum, therefore, is this. The conveyal of knowledge by words is in
direct proportion to the stores and faculties of observation (internal
or external) of the person who hears or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> reads them. And this holds
equally whether I distinguish the green grass from the white lily and
the yellow crocus, which all who have eyes understand, because all are
equal to me in the knowledge of the facts signified&mdash;or of the
difference between the apprehensive, perceptive, conceptive, and
conclusive powers which I might [try to enunciate to] Doctors of
Divinity and they would translate the words by <i>Abra Ca Dabra</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOWERS OF SPEECH Sunday, April 30, 1816</div>

<p>Reflections on my four gaudy flower-pots, compared with the former
flower-poems. After a certain period, crowded with counterfeiters of
poetry, and illustrious with true poets, there is formed for common use
a vast <i>garden</i> of language, all the showy and all the odorous words and
clusters of words are brought together, and to be plucked by mere
mechanic and passive memory. In such a state, any man of common poetical
reading, having a strong desire (to be?&mdash;O no! but&mdash;) to be thought a
poet will present a flower-pot gay and gaudy, but the <i>composition</i>!
That is wanting. We carry on judgment of times and circumstances into
our pleasures. A flower-pot which would have enchanted us before flower
gardens were common, for the very beauty of the component flowers, will
be rightly condemned as common-place, out of place (for such is a
common-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> poet)&mdash;it involves a contradiction both in terms and
thought. So Homer's Juno, Minerva, etc., are read with delight&mdash;but
Blackmore? This is the reason why the judgment of those who are newlings
in poetic reading is not to be relied on. The positive, which belongs to
all, is taken as the comparative, which is the individual's praise. A
good ear which had never heard music&mdash;with what raptures would it praise
one of Shield's or Arne's Pasticcios and Centos! But it is the human
mind it praises, not the individual. Hence it may happen (I believe has
happened) that fashionableness may produce popularity. "The Beggar's
Petition" is a fair instance, and what if I dared to add Gray's "Elegy
in a Country Churchyard"?</p>

<p>A valuable remark has just struck me on reading Milton's beautiful

of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> admirable passages, in our elder writers, that may be gotten by
heart as the most exquisite poems; and to point out the great
intellectual advantage of this reading, over the gliding smoothly on
through a whole volume of equability. But still, it will be said, there
is an antiquity, an oddness in the style. Granted; but hear this same
passage from the Smectymnuus, or this, or this. Every one would know at
first hearing that they were not written by Gibbon, Hume, Johnson, or
Robertson. But why? Are they not pure English? Aye! incomparably more
so! Are not the words precisely appropriate, so that you cannot change
them without changing the force and meaning? Aye! But are they not even
now intelligible to man, woman, and child? Aye! there is no
riddle-my-ree in them. What, then, is it? The unnatural, false, affected

<div class="sidenote">A PLEA FOR SCHOLASTIC TERMS</div>

<p>The revival of classical literature, like all other revolutions, was not
an unmixed good. One evil was the passion for pure Latinity, and a
consequent contempt for the barbarism of the scholastic style and
terminology. For awhile the schoolmen made head against their
assailants; but, alas! all the genius and eloquence of the world was
against them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> and by an additional misfortune the scholastic logic was
professed by those who had no other attainments, namely, the monks, and
these, from monkishness, were the enemies of all genius and liberal
knowledge. They were, of course, laughed out of the field as soon as
they lost the power of aiding their logic by the post-predicaments of
dungeon, fire, and faggot. Henceforward speculative philosophy must be
written classically, that is, without technical terms&mdash;therefore
popularly&mdash;and the inevitable consequence was that those sciences only
were progressive which were permitted by the apparent as well as real
necessity of the case to have a scientific terminology&mdash;as mathesis,
geometry, astronomy and so forth&mdash;while metaphysic sank and died, and an
empirical highly superficial psychology took its place. And so it has
remained in England to the present day. A man must have felt the pain of
being compelled to express himself either laxly or paraphrastically
(which latter is almost as great an impediment in intellectual
construction as the translation of letters and symbols into the thought
they represent would be in Algebra), in order to understand how much a
metaphysician suffers from not daring to adopt the <i>ivitates</i> and
<i>eitates</i> of the schoolmen as objectivity, subjectivity, negativity,
positivity. April 29, 1817, Tuesday night.</p>

be <i>unique</i>, and therefore cannot be supported by an analogue, and
which, if it be at all, must be first, and therefore cannot have an

do not contend for indescribable sensations, nor refer to, much less
ground my convictions on, blind feelings or incommunicable experiences,
but far rather contend against these superstitions in the mechanic sect,
and impeach you as guilty, habitually and systematically guilty, of the
same. Guilty, I say, of superstitions, which at worst are but exceptions
and <i>fits</i> in the poor self-misapprehending pietists, with whom, under
the name mystics, you would fain confound and discredit <i>all</i> who
receive and worship God in spirit and in truth, and in the former as
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> only possible mode of the latter. According to your own account,
your own scheme, you know nothing but your own sensations, indescribable
inasmuch as they are sensations&mdash;for the appropriate expression even of
which we must fly not merely to the indeclinables in the lowest parts of
speech, but to human articulations that only (like musical notes) <i>stand
for</i> inarticulate sounds&mdash;the &#959;&#953;, &#959;&#953;, &#960;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#953; of the Greek
tragedies, or, rather, Greek oratorios. You see nothing, but only by a
sensation that conjures up an image in your own brain, or optic nerve
(as in a nightmare), have an apparition, in consequence of which, as
again in the nightmare, you are <i>forced</i> to believe for the moment, and
are <i>inclined</i> to infer the existence of a corresponding reality out of
your brain, but by what intermediation you cannot even form an
intelligible conjecture. During the years of ill-health from disturbed
digestion, I saw a host of apparitions, and heard them too&mdash;but I
attributed them to an act in my brain. You, according to your own
showing, see and hear nothing but apparitions in your brain, and
strangely attribute them to things that <i>are</i> outside your skull. Which
of the two notions is most like the philosopher, which the
superstitionist? The philosopher who makes my apparitions nothing but
apparitions&mdash;a brain-image nothing more than a brain-image&mdash;and affirm
<i>nihil super stare</i>&mdash;or you and yours who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> vehemently contend that it is

is an x&nbsp;y&nbsp;z, an acknowledged insufficiency of the known to account for
itself, and, therefore, a something unknown&mdash;that to which, while the
atheist leaves it a blank in the understanding, the theist dedicates his
noblest feelings of love and awe, and with which, by a moral syllogism,
he connects and unites his conscience and actions. For the words
goodness and wisdom are clearly only reflexes of the effect, just as
when we call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span> unknown cause of cold and heat by the name of its
effects, and <i>know</i> nothing further. For if we mean that a Being like
man, with human goodness and intellect, only magnified, is the cause,
that is, that the First Cause is an immense man (as according to
Swedenborg and Zinzendorf), then come the insoluble difficulties of the
incongruity of qualities whose very essence implies finiteness, with a
Being <i>ex hypothesi</i> infinite.</p>

<p>An excellent instance of the abstraction [from objects of the sense]

furnished by the oily rags, broken saucers, greasy phials, dabs, crusts,

Lorraine, or a Van Huysum, or any other great master of the beautiful

a Chantrey&mdash;what are they to him whose total soul is awake, in his eye
as a subject, and before his eye as some ideal of beauty <i>objectively</i>?

<div class="sidenote">THE LITERARY STERILITY OF ISLAMISM</div>

<p>The extraordinary florency of letters under the Spanish Caliphate in
connection with the character and capabilities of Mohammedanism has
never yet been treated as its importance requires. Halim II, founder of
the University of Cordova, and of numerous colleges and libraries
throughout Spain, is said to have possessed a library of six hundred
thousand MSS., the catalogue filling forty-four volumes. Nor were his
successors behind him in zeal and munificence. That the prime article of
Islamism, the uni-personality of God, is one cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> downfall, say
rather of the merely meteoric existence of their literary age, I am
persuaded, but the exclusive scene (in Spain) suggests many interesting
views. With a learned class Mohammedanism could not but pass into Deism,
and Deism never did, never can, establish itself as a religion. It is
the doctrine of the tri-unity that connects Christianity with
philosophy, gives a positive religion a specific interest to the
philosopher, and that of redemption to the moralist and psychologist.
Predestination, in the plenitude, in which it is equivalent to fatalism,
was the necessary alternative and <i>succedaneum</i> of Redemption, and the
Incarnation the only preservative against pantheism on one side, and
anthropomorphism on the other. The Persian (Europeans in Asia) form of
Mohammedanism is very striking in this point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPIRIT OF A PEOPLE</div>

<p>It is not by individual character that an individual can derive just
conclusions respecting a community or an age. Conclusions so drawn are
the excuse of selfish, narrow and pusillanimous statesmen, who, by
dwelling on the kindred baseness or folly of the persons with whom they
come in immediate contact, lose all faith in human nature, ignorant that
even in these a spark is latent which would light up and consume the
worthless overlay in a national moment. The spirit of a race is the
character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> of a people, the sleep or the awakening of which depends on a
few minds, pre-ordained for this purpose, and sometimes by the mere
removal of the dead weight of a degenerate Court or nobility pressing on
the spring. So I doubt not would it be with the Turks, were the Porte
and its seraglio conquered by Russia. But the spirit of a race ought
never to be supposed extinct, but on the other hand no more or other
ought to be expected than the race contains in itself. The true cause of
the irrecoverable fall of Rome is to be found in the fact, that Rome was
a city, a handful of men that multiplied its subjects incomparably
faster than its citizens, so that the latter were soon dilute and lost
in the former. On a similar principle colonists in modern times
degenerate by <i>excision</i> from their race (the ancient colonies were
<i>buds</i>). This, I think, applies to the Neapolitans and most of the
Italian States. A nest of republics keep each other alive; but a
patchwork of principalities has the effect of excision by insulation, or
rather by compressure. How long did the life of Germany doze under these
ligatures! Yet did we not <i>despair wrongfully</i> of the people? The spirit
of the race survived, of which literature was a part. Hence I dare not
despair of Greece, because it has been barbarised and enslaved, but not
split up into puny independent governments under Princes of their own
race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> The Neapolitans have always been a conquered people, and
degenerates in the original sense of the word, <i>de genere</i>&mdash;they have
lost their race, though what it was is uncertain. Lastly, the individual
in all things is the prerogative of the divine knowledge. What it is,
our eyes can see only by what it has in common, and this can only be
seen in communities where neither excision, nor ligature, nor commixture
exists. Despotism and superstition will not extinguish the character of
a race, as Russia testifies. But again, take care to understand that
character, and expect no other fruit than the root contains in its
nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRUDENCE <i>VERSUS</i> FRIENDSHIP</div>

<p>Among the countless arguments against the Paleyans state, this too&mdash;Can
a wise moral legislator have made <i>prudence</i> the true principle-ground,
and guide of moral conduct, where in almost all cases in which there is
contemplation to act wrong the first appearances of prudence are in
favour of immorality, and, in order to ground the contrary on a
principle of prudence, it is necessary to refine, to calculate, to look
far onward into an uncertain future? Is this a guide, or primary guide,
that for ever requires a guide against itself? Is it not a strange
system which sets prudence against prudence? Compare this with the Law
of Conscience&mdash;Is it not its specific character to be immediate,
positive, unalterable? In short, <i>a priori</i>, state the requisites of a
moral guide, and apply them first to prudence, and then to the law of
pure reason or conscience, and ask if we need fear the result if the
Judge is pure from all bribes and prejudices.</p>

<p>What then are the real dictates of prudence as drawn from every man's
experience in late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> manhood, and so lured from the intoxication of
youth, hope, and love? How cold, how dead'ning, what a dire vacuum they
would leave in the soul, if the high and supreme sense of duty did not
form a root out of which new prospects budded. What, I say, is the clear
dictate of prudence in the matter of friendship? Assuredly to <i>like</i>
only, and never to be so attached as to be stripped naked by the loss. A
friend may be a great-coat, a beloved a couch, but never, never our
necessary clothing, our only means of quiet heart-repose! And, yet, with
this the mind of a generous man would be so miserable, that prudence
itself would fight against prudence, and advise him to drink off the
draught of Hope, spite of the horrid and bitter dregs of disappointment,
with which the draught will assuredly finish.</p>

<p>Though I have said that duty is a consolation, I have not affirmed that
the scar of the wound of disappointed love and insulted, betrayed
fidelity would be removed in <i>this</i> life. No! it will not&mdash;nay, the very
duty must for ever keep alive feelings the appropriate objects of which
are indeed in another world; but yet our human nature cannot avoid at
times the connection of those feelings with their original or their
first forms and objects; and so far, therefore, from removing the scar,
will often and often make the wound open and bleed afresh. But, still,
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> know that the feeling is not objectless, that the counterfeit has a
correspondent genuine, and this is the comfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILTON AND SHAKSPERE</div>

<p>Found Mr. G. with Hartley in the garden, attempting to explain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
himself and to Hartley a feeling of a something not present in Milton's
works, that is, in "Paradise Lost,"Paradise Regained,"
and "Samson Agonistes," which he <i>did</i> feel delightedly in the "Lycidas," and (as I
added afterwards) in the Italian sonnets compared with the English. And
this appeared to me to be the <i>poet</i> appearing and wishing to appear as
the poet, and, likewise, as the man, as much as, though more rare than,
the father, the brother, the preacher, and the patriot. Compare with
Milton, Chaucer's "Fall of the Leaf" and Spenser throughout, and you
cannot but <i>feel</i> what Gillman meant to convey. What is the solution?
This, I believe&mdash;but I must premise that there is a <i>synthesis</i> of
intellectual insight including the mental object, the organ of the
correspondent being indivisible, and this (O deep truth!) because the
objectivity consists in the universality of its subjectiveness&mdash;as when
it <i>sees</i>, and millions <i>see</i> even so, and the seeing of the millions is
what constitutes to <i>A</i> and to each of the millions the <i>objectivity</i> of
the sight, the equivalent to a common object&mdash;a synthesis of <i>this</i>, I
say, and of proper external object which we call <i>fact</i>. Now, this it is
which we find in religion. It is more than philosophical truth&mdash;it is
other and more than historical fact; it is not made up by the addition
of the one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> the other, but it is the <i>identity</i> of both, the
co-inherence.</p>

<p>Now, this being understood, I proceed to say, using the term objectivity
(arbitrarily, I grant), for this identity of truth and fact, that Milton
hid the poetry in or transformed (not trans-substantiated) the poetry
into this objectivity, while Shakspere, in all things, the divine
opposite or antithetic correspondent of the divine Milton, transformed
the objectivity into poetry.</p>

<p>Mr. G. observed as peculiar to the Hamlet, that it alone, of all
Shakspere's plays, presented to him a moving along <i>before</i> him; while
in others it was a moving, indeed, but with which he himself moved
equally in all and with all, and without any external something by which
the motion was manifested, even as a man would move in a balloon&mdash;a
sensation of motion, but not a sight of moving and having been moved.
And why is this? Because of all the characters of Shakspere's plays
Hamlet is the only character with which, by contra-distinction from the
rest of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, the fit and capable reader identifies
himself as the representation of his own contemplative and strictly
proper and very own being (action, etc., belongs to others, the moment
we call it our own)&mdash;hence the events of the play, with all the
characters, move because you stand still. In the other plays, your
identity is equally diffused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> over all. Of no parts can you say, as in
Hamlet, they are moving. But ever it is <i>we</i>, or that period and portion
of human action, which is unified into a dream, even as in a dream the
personal unity is diffused and severalised (divided to the sight though
united in the dim feeling) into a sort of reality. Even so [it is with]
the styles of Milton and Shakspere&mdash;the same weight of effect from the
exceeding <i>felicity</i> (subjectively) of Shakspere, and the exceeding
<i>propriety</i> (<i>extra arbitrium</i>) of Milton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A ROYAL ROAD TO KNOWLEDGE</div>

<p>The best plan, I think, for a man who would wish his mind to continue
growing is to find, in the first place, some means of ascertaining for
himself whether it does or no; and I can think of no better than early
in life, say after three-and-twenty, to procure gradually the works of
some two or three great writers&mdash;say, for instance, Bacon, Jeremy
Taylor, and Kant, with the <i>De Republicâ</i>, <i>De Legibus</i>, the
<i>Sophistes</i>
and <i>Politicus</i> of Plato, and the <i>Poetics</i>,
<i>Rhetorics</i>, and <i>Politics</i>
of Aristotle&mdash;and amidst all other reading, to make a point of
reperusing some one, or some weighty part of some one of these every
four or five years, having from the beginning a separate note-book for
each of these writers, in which your impressions, suggestions,
conjectures, doubts and judgments are to be recorded with date of each,
and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span> worded as to represent most sincerely the exact state of your
convictions at the time, such as they would be if you did not (which
this plan will assuredly make you do sooner or later) anticipate a
change in them from increase of knowledge. "It is possible that I am in
the wrong, but so it now appears to me, after my best attempts; and I
must therefore put it down in order that I may find myself so, if so I
am." It would make a little volume to give in detail all the various
moral as well as intellectual advantages that would result from the
systematic observation of the plan. Diffidence and hope would
reciprocally balance and excite each other. A continuity would be given
to your being, and its progressiveness ensured. All your knowledge
otherwise obtained, whether from books or conversation or experience,
would find centres round which it would organise itself. And, lastly,
the habit of confuting your past self, and detecting the causes and
occasions of your having mistaken or overlooked the truth, will give you
both a quickness and a winning kindness, resulting from sympathy, in
exposing the errors of others, as if you were an <i>alter ego</i>, of his
mistake. And such, indeed, will your antagonist appear to you, another
past self&mdash;in all points in which the falsity is not too plainly a
derivation from a corrupt heart and the predominance of bad passion or
worldly interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> overlaying the love of truth as truth. And even in
this case the liveliness with which you will so often have expressed
yourself in your private note-books, in which the words, unsought for
and untrimmed because intended for your own eye, exclusively, were the
first-born of your first impressions, when you were either enkindled by
admiration of your writer, or excited by a humble disputing with him
reimpersonated in his book, will be of no mean rhetorical advantage to
you, especially in public and extemporary debate or animated

<p>Spring flowers, I have observed, look best in the day, and by sunshine:
but summer and autumnal flower-pots by lamp or candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>-light. I have now
before me a flower-pot of cherry-blossoms, polyanthuses, double violets,
periwinkles, wall-flowers, but how dim and dusky they look! The scarlet
anemone is an exception, and three or four of them with all the rest of
the flower-glass sprays of white blossoms, and one or two periwinkles
for the sake of the dark green leaves, green stems, and flexible elegant
form, make a lovely group both by sun and by candle-light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BREATH OF SPRING Feb. 28, 1827</div>

<p>What an interval! Heard the singing birds this morning in our garden for
the first time this year, though it rained and blew fiercely; but the
long frost has broken up, and the wind, though fierce, was warm and
westerly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IDEA OF LIFE May 5, 1827</div>

<p>To the right understanding of the most awfully <i>concerning</i> declaration
of Holy Writ there has been no greater obstacle than the want of insight
into the nature of Life&mdash;what it is and what it is not. But in order to
this, the mind must have been raised to the contemplation of the
<i>Idea</i>&mdash;the life celestial, to wit&mdash;or the distinctive essence and
character of the Holy Spirit. Here Life is <i>Love</i>&mdash;communicative,
outpouring love. <i>Ergo</i>, the terrestrial or the Life of Nature ever the
shadow and opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> of the Divine is appropriative, absorbing
<i>appetence</i>. But the great mistake is, that the soul cannot continue
without life; for, if so, with what propriety can the portion of the
reprobate soul be called Death? What if the natural life have two
possible terminations&mdash;true Being and the falling back into the dark
Will?</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<div class="sidenote">A COMPREHENSIVE FORMULA</div>

<p>The painter-parson, Rev. Mr. Judkin, is about to show off a Romish
priest converted to the Protestant belief, on Sunday next at his church,
and asked of me (this day, at Mr. Gray's, Friday, 27th July, 1827)
whether I knew of any form of recantation but that of Archbishop
Tenison. I knew nothing of Tenison's or any other, but expressed my
opinion that no other recantation ought to be required than a
declaration that he admitted no outward authority superior to, or
co-ordinate with, the canonical Scriptures, and no interpreter that
superseded or stood in the place of the Holy Spirit, enlightening the
mind of each true believer, according to his individual needs. I can
conceive a person holding all the articles that distinguish the Romish
from the Protestant conception, with this one exception; and, yet, if he
did make this exception, and professed to believe them, because he
thought they were contained in, or to be fairly inferred from, right
reason and the Scriptures, I should consider him as true a Protestant
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> Luther, Knox, or Calvin, and a far better than Laud and his
compeers, however meanly I might think of him as a philosopher and
theologian. The laying so great a stress on transubstantiation I have
long regarded as the great calamity or error of the Reformation&mdash;if not
constrained by circumstances, the great <i>error</i>&mdash;or, if constrained, the
great <i>calamity</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NIGHT IS AT HAND August 1, 1828</div>

<p>The sweet prattle of the chimes&mdash;counsellors pleading in the court of
Love&mdash;then the clock, the solemn sentence of the mighty Judge&mdash;long
pause between each pregnant, inappellable word, too deeply weighed to be
reversed in the High-Justice-Court of Time and Fate. A more richly
solemn sound than this eleven o'clock at Antwerp I never heard&mdash;dead
enough to be opaque as central gold, yet clear enough to be the mountain
air.</p>
